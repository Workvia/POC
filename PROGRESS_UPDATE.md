- Left sidebar with fields (348px)
- Main content with tabs
- Summary card

### Step 7: Convex Backend

npm install convex
npx convex dev
```

Create schema and queries for real data.

Try:

- See the companies table
- Navigate through all pages
- This is the foundation we'll convert to use Tailwind, shadcn, and Next.js

## 📈 Timeline

- ✅ **Day 1 (Today)**: Foundation + Navigation + Basic Page
- ⏳ **Day 2**: Enhanced Table + Detail Page
- ⏳ **Day 3**: Convex + People Page
- ⏳ **Day 4**: shadcn + Preserved Pages

**Total**: ~4 days remaining

## 🎯 What's Different from Before

**Before**: Tried to port Twenty to your existing codebase
**Now**: Using Twenty as foundation, converting to your stack

**Result**: Much faster, cleaner, and matches Twenty exactly!

**Current Status**: Twenty CRM frontend running successfully! ✅
**Server**: http://localhost:3001 🚀
**Next**: Convert Twenty components to use Tailwind, shadcn, and Next.js

## 🎉 Major Update

We've successfully:
1. Cloned Twenty CRM repository
2. Installed Node v24 and Yarn
3. Installed all dependencies
4. Started Twenty's actual frontend

**Twenty is now running at http://localhost:3001**

This is the correct approach - we're using Twenty's ACTUAL codebase as the foundation. Next steps will involve converting Twenty's:
- Emotion styling → Tailwind CSS
- React Router → Next.js App Router
- GraphQL backend → Convex
- Vite build → Next.js build

While preserving:
- Via MVP's Assistant page
- Via MVP's Proposal workflow page
