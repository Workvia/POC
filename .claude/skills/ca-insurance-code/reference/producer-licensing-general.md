(a) Each limited liability company, at the time of licensing pursuant to this chapter and, with respect to surplus line brokers, Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 1760), and at all times during which the company holds an active license, is required to provide security for claims against it as follows:

(1) For claims based upon acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the practice of insurance agency, brokerage, or surplus line brokerage, a licensed limited liability company providing insurance agency, brokerage, or surplus line brokerage services shall comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B), or pursuant to subdivision (b), some combination of those requirements.

(A) (i) Maintain a policy or policies of insurance against liability imposed on or against it by law for damages arising out of claims in an amount for each claim of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) multiplied by the number of licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the company, with a minimum required amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); however, the maximum amount of insurance is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) for claims initially asserted in any one calendar year, less amounts paid in defending, settling, or discharging those claims. In addition, the policy shall contain, at a minimum, a provision that the policy cannot be nonrenewed, canceled, or terminated, without providing written notice to the commissioner within 10 days.

(ii) An applicant who wishes to satisfy the requirements of this section wholly, or in part, by maintaining a policy or policies of insurance as set forth in clause (i) shall submit to the commissioner a certification of coverage pursuant to subdivision (d). If a license is automatically issued or renewed without providing this certification, the license may be inactivated by the commissioner upon discovery of the lack of compliance with this paragraph.

(iii) If the policy specified in clause (i) contains a deductible or self-insured retention and the policy provides that the insurer is ultimately responsible for payment of the total amount of the claim up to the policy limits, including the deductible or retention, the policyholder shall not be required to maintain security for payment of its deductible limit or self-insured retention liability under the terms set forth in subparagraph (B).

(iv) If the policy specified in clause (i) contains a deductible limit or self-insured retention and does not provide that the insurer is responsible for payment of the total amount of the claim up to the policy limits, the policyholder shall maintain security for payment of its deductible limit or self-insured retention under the terms set forth in subparagraph (B).

(B) Maintain in trust or bank escrow, cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit, or bonds of insurance companies as security for payment of liabilities imposed by law for damages arising out of all claims in an amount of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) multiplied by the number of licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the company, with a minimum required amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); however, the maximum amount of security is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) for claims initially asserted in any one calendar year, less amounts paid in defending, settling, or discharging those claims.

(b) For purposes of satisfying the security requirements of this section, a limited liability company may aggregate the security provided by it pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).

(c) At the time of licensing pursuant to this article, limited liability companies shall file with the commissioner information, in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, and accompanied by all documentation requested by the commissioner, demonstrating compliance with the financial security requirements of this section. Limited liability companies shall also file an annual confirmation with the commissioner, at a time and in a manner, and with documentation, prescribed by the commissioner, demonstrating continuing compliance with the financial security requirements of this section.

(d) If the security requirements of this section are satisfied wholly, or in part, with an insurance policy, then a certification of coverage shall be submitted to the commissioner by the licensee or applicant, and signed by an authorized agent or employee of the insurer. The certification of coverage shall be in the following form:

(e) The commissioner may summarily deny or decline to act upon an application for the issuance or renewal of a license, or may summarily inactivate an existing license, for failure to comply with the requirements of this section.

(1) If the commissioner inactivates a license for failure to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), the effective date of the inactivation shall be the date on which the insurance policy or policies used to satisfy that requirement expire or are canceled, as indicated by the expiration date specified on the certification of coverage filed pursuant to subdivision (d) or by a notification received from the insurer of termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of coverage.

(2) If the commissioner inactivates a license for failure to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), or with the requirements of subdivision (b), the effective date of the inactivation shall be the date set by the commissioner as the deadline for demonstrating compliance with those provisions.

(3) Within 10 working days of the date of inactivation under this section, the commissioner shall send by certified mail to the licensee’s address, as reflected in the commissioner’s records, a notice to the licensee of the inactivation of the license.

(4) A license that has been inactivated pursuant to this section shall be reactivated if, within 30 days of the date of inactivation, the licensee demonstrates, in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, satisfaction of the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), or the requirements of subdivision (b), and includes any fees, penalties, and any other required licensing documents necessary to reactivate the license, including new company appointment forms, bonds, and any new business entity endorsements as required. If a certification of coverage is provided to demonstrate compliance with these requirements, and the certification indicates that the insurance policy or policies have been in effect continuously from the date of the inactivation, the license shall be reactivated retroactive to and including the date of inactivation. If the certification of coverage shows an effective date for the insurance policy or policies later than the date of inactivation, the license shall be reactivated as of the effective date of the policy or policies.

(f) Any licensee who, acting alone or in concert with others, willfully or knowingly causes or allows to be filed with the commissioner for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with this section a certification of coverage described in subdivision (d), or any other document required by this section, that is false, fraudulent, or misleading, shall be subject to administrative penalty, including suspension or revocation of the licensee’s license, after notice and hearing as provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act. However, nothing in this section shall entitle a licensee to notice or hearing on the summary denial of an application or the summary inactivation of a license pursuant to subdivision (e).

(g) The commissioner may disclose on the department’s Internet Web site the names and license numbers of those licensees whose licenses have been inactivated or who have been penalized due to noncompliance with this section. The commissioner may also report that information to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

(h) The commissioner may adopt regulations as necessary to implement this section.

licensee;

(b) The use of the name may mislead the public in any respect;

(c) The name states, infers or implies that the licensee is an insurer, motor club, hospital service plan or entitled to engage in insurance activities not permitted under licenses held or applied for;

The commissioner, in any proceeding under the provisions of this article, may, by an alternative order, permit a licensee to elect in writing to pay a specified money penalty, within a specified time in lieu of a license suspension or other permitted action. If the licensee so elects, the sum of money specified shall be paid to the commissioner for the use of the State of California. The sum specified shall not exceed:

(a) Four thousand dollars ($4,000) for each offense.

(b) Twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in the aggregate for all offenses involved in any one proceeding.

(c) Thirty percent of the gross commissions on insurance transacted by the licensee in the preceding calendar year.

(d) Any amount proven, or admitted, in the proceeding to have been received and retained by the licensee in violation of this code.

The commissioner shall determine the monetary penalty to be paid in any given case and in so doing shall not be limited to the selection of the penalty specified in any one of the above subdivisions, as compared with the penalty in any of the other three subdivisions, that will result in the payment by the licensee of the least amount.

The amount of reimbursement the commissioner orders shall be the amount that fully reimburses the commissioner for the commissioner’s costs, or any lesser amount that the commissioner determines is the most the subject of the order can pay in the event the subject is financially unable to fully reimburse the commissioner.

If a licensee fails to pay a monetary penalty or reimbursement within the time specified in the order, the commissioner, unless the order is lawfully stayed, may deny a pending application for a license, or may revoke or suspend the license of the subject of the order for a period of time as determined by the commissioner. If, for any reason, an application is denied, or a license is revoked or suspended, before the subject of the order has paid the full amount of an ordered monetary penalty or reimbursement, the balance owed shall be paid before a license may be reinstated or an application for any new license may be granted.

(b) If, after notice and a hearing, the commissioner finds all of the following, the commissioner may issue an order removing a subject person from the subject person’s office or employment with the production agency and prohibiting the subject person from participating in any manner in the conduct of the business of an insurer or production agency, except with the prior consent of the commissioner:

(c) (1) If the commissioner gives written notice pursuant to subdivision (b) to a subject person, the commissioner shall immediately issue an order prohibiting the subject person from participating in any manner in the business of insurance, except with the prior
consent of the commissioner, if the commissioner: (A) finds that failure to immediately issue the order threatens the financial solvency of an insurer or may reasonably be expected to cause irreparable injury to any person; (B) serves that subject person and the production agency with written notice of the suspension order; and (C) finds that all of the necessary factors are present which would permit the commissioner, after notice and a hearing, to issue an order pursuant to subdivision (b) removing a subject person from the subject person’s office or employment with the production agency and prohibiting the subject person from participating in any manner in the business of an insurer or production agency.

(2) Any suspension order issued pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be effective until the date the commissioner dismisses

punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and has as one of its necessary elements a fraudulent act or an act of dishonesty in the accepting, custody, or payment of money or property; and (B) that a failure to immediately issue the order threatens the financial solvency of an insurer or may cause financial or other injury to any person.

(3) The fact that any subject person charged with a crime involving as one of its necessary elements a fraudulent act or any act of dishonesty in the acceptance, custody, or payment of money or property is not convicted of that crime shall not preclude the commissioner from issuing an order regarding the subject person pursuant to other provisions of this code.

(2) The right of any subject person to whom an order is issued pursuant to subdivision (b), (c), or (e) to petition for judicial review of the order shall not be affected by the failure of that subject person to apply to the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (1).

In determining the amount of civil penalty to be paid to the commissioner under this paragraph, the commissioner shall consider the financial resources and good faith of the subject person charged, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations
by the person, and other factors as in the opinion of the commissioner may be relevant.

(3) If, after notice and a hearing, the commissioner finds that any production agency has knowingly aided and abetted a subject person in a violation of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, or subdivision (h) of Section 728, the commissioner may order that production agency to pay to the commissioner a civil penalty in an amount the commissioner may specify; provided however, that the amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation or in the case of a continuing violation, one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day for which the violation continues, up to a maximum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).

(4) If the Office of Administrative Hearings cannot schedule the commencement of a hearing within 15 business days as provided by paragraph (1) of subdivision (f), and the subject person does not waive the person’s right
to a hearing
commencing within 15 days, the hearings may be conducted by administrative law judges appointed by the commissioner; the hearing shall be completed within 45 days of commencement, unless additional time is requested by the subject person. If the hearing is not completed within the 45 days, the order shall be deemed rescinded as if it had not been issued. The scheduling of other hearings before the administrative law judge shall not be considered good cause for purposes of this paragraph.

(j) Nothing in this section is intended to or shall be construed to create a private cause of action against an offending subject person or insurer or production agency that aids and abets a subject person, based on the standards established by this section or the commissioner’s findings or orders pursuant to this
section.

(c) The training required by this section shall be approved by the commissioner and shall consist of topics related to annuities, and California law, regulations, and requirements related to annuities, prohibited sales practices, the recognition of indicators that a prospective insured may lack the short-term memory or judgment to knowingly purchase an insurance product, and fraudulent and unfair trade practices.

which payment is arranged through a credit transaction, or any successor to the right, title, or interest of that lender, vendor, or lessor, and any affiliate, associate, subsidiary, subcontractor, director, officer, or employee of any of them or any other person in any way associated with any of them.

(c) “Credit insurance agent license” means an agent license issued to an individual or organization for the enrollment and sale of credit insurance.

(e) (1) “Credit life insurance” means insurance on the life of a debtor pursuant to or in connection with a specific loan or other credit transaction, exclusive of any insurance procured at no expense to the debtor. Insurance shall be deemed procured at no expense to the debtor unless the cost of the credit transaction to the debtor varies depending on whether or not the insurance is procured.

(2) “Credit disability
insurance” means insurance on a debtor to provide indemnity for payments becoming due on a specific loan or other credit transaction while the debtor is disabled, as defined in the policy, exclusive of any insurance procured at no expense to the debtor.

(f) “Credit involuntary unemployment insurance” or “credit loss-of-income insurance” means insurance issued to provide indemnity for payments becoming due on a specific loan or other credit transaction while the debtor is involuntarily unemployed, as defined in the policy.

(g) “Credit property insurance” means insurance that provides coverage (1) on personal property pledged or offered as collateral for securing a personal or consumer loan,
or (2) on personal property purchased under an installment sales agreement or through a consumer credit transaction, but does not include any insurance that provides theft, collision, liability, property damage, or comprehensive insurance coverage in any automobile or any other self-propelled vehicle that is designed primarily for operation in the air or on the highways, waterways, or sea, and its operating equipment, or that is necessitated by reason of the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of those vehicles. However, that excluded insurance does include single interest coverage on any of those vehicles that insures the interest of the creditor in the same manner as collateral secures a loan.

(h) (1) “Guaranteed asset protection” (GAP) insurance means insurance in which a person agrees to indemnify a vehicle purchaser or lessee for some or all of the amount
owed on the vehicle at the time of an unrecovered theft or total loss, after credit for money received from the purchaser’s or lessee’s physical damage insurer, pursuant to the terms of a loan, lease agreement, or conditional sales contract used to purchase or lease the vehicle. GAP insurance, whether sold by a credit insurance agent or another type of licensee authorized to sell GAP insurance, may also include a promise to pay up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) to an insured, in addition to the sum needed to indemnify the insured for the amount owed, to purchase or lease another vehicle.

(2) GAP insurance does not include, and no insurance license of any type under this code is required to offer, any of the following:

(A) A debt cancellation agreement contained in a conditional sales contract for the sale of a vehicle by a licensed motor vehicle dealer, or a debt cancellation

(ii) The amount owed on the vehicle at the time of an unrecovered theft or total loss, after credit for money received from the purchaser’s or lessee’s physical damage insurer or from a third-party liability insurer. Such a promise may also include a promise to waive some or all of the amount of the purchaser’s or lessee’s deductible.

(B) A promise by a lender as part
of a debt obligation to purchase or lease a vehicle in which the lender agrees to waive some or all of either of the following:

(i) The difference between the actual cash value of the purchaser’s or lessee’s vehicle at the time of an unrecovered theft or total loss and the amount owed on the vehicle pursuant to the terms of the debt obligation used to purchase or lease the vehicle.

(ii) The amount owed on the vehicle at the time of an unrecovered theft or total loss, after credit for money received from the purchaser’s or lessee’s physical damage insurer or from a third-party liability insurer. Such a promise may also include a promise to waive some or all of the amount of the purchaser’s or lessee’s deductible.

(C) Coverage under subparagraphs (A) and (B) may not result in a credit balance in favor of the vehicle
purchaser or lessee or include a promise to pay money to a vehicle purchaser or lessee in addition to waiving some or all of the amount owed, including some or all of the amount of the purchaser’s or lessee’s deductible. For purposes of this paragraph, a promise to pay money does not include, and a dealer, creditor, or lender shall be allowed to offer, a discount or credit to a purchaser or lessee as an incentive for purchasing, leasing, or financing a replacement vehicle. However, the dealer, creditor, or lender shall require the purchaser or lessee to use the discount or credit on a purchase or lease from the dealer or lessor that sold or leased the original vehicle to the purchaser or lessee, or with the creditor or lender that financed the purchase or lease of the original vehicle.
