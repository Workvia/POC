The surplus line broker shall be responsible for determining whether an applicant for nonadmitted insurance is a California home state insured. A surplus line broker who reasonably relies on information provided in good faith by the applicant, whether directly or through the producer, shall be deemed to be in compliance with this requirement.

*(Added by Stats. 2011, Ch. 83, Sec. 10. (AB 315) Effective July 15, 2011. Operative July 21, 2011, by Sec. 34 of Stats. 2011, Ch. 83.)*

(a) The provisions of this chapter limiting the insurance that may be placed with nonadmitted insurers and requiring any report thereof shall not apply to:

(1) Reinsurance of the liability of an admitted insurer.

(2) Insurance against perils of navigation, transit, or transportation upon hulls, freights or disbursements, or other shipowner interests; upon goods, wares, merchandise, and all other personal property and interests therein, in the course of exportation from or importation into any country, or transportation coastwise, including transportation by land or water from point of origin to final destination and

(3) Aircraft or spacecraft insurance.

(4) Insurance on property or operations of railroads engaged in interstate commerce.

(b) The insurance specified in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subdivision (a) may be placed with a nonadmitted insurer for a home state insured only by and through a special lines’ surplus line broker. The license of a special lines’ surplus line broker shall be applied for and procured and shall be subject to the same fees for filing on issuance in the same manner as the license of a surplus line broker, except that in lieu of the bond required by Section 1765, there shall be
delivered to the commissioner a bond in the form, amounts, and conditions specified in Sections 1663 and 1665 for an insurance broker and only one fee shall be collected from one person for both licenses. The licensee in respect to the business shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter except Sections 1761, 1763, 1765.1, 1765.2, and 1775.5.

(c) The commissioner may address to any licensed special lines’ surplus line broker a written request for full and complete information respecting the financial stability, reputation, and integrity of any nonadmitted insurer with whom the licensee has dealt or proposes to deal in the transaction of insurance specified in paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of subdivision (a). The licensee so addressed
shall promptly furnish in written or printed form so much of the information requested as he or she can produce together with a signed statement identifying the same and giving reasons for omissions, if any. After due examination of the information and accompanying statement, the commissioner may, if he or she believes it to be in the public interest, order in writing the licensee to place no further insurance business for home state insureds with that nonadmitted insurer on behalf of any person. Any placement with that nonadmitted insurer made by a licensee after receipt of the order is a violation of this chapter. The commissioner may issue an order if he or she finds that a nonadmitted insurer with whom the licensee has dealt or proposes to deal in the transaction of insurance is in an unsound financial condition, is disreputable, or is lacking in integrity. The order shall also include notice of a hearing to be held at a time and place fixed therein, which shall be not less than 20 nor more than 30 days
from service of the order upon the licensee.

(g) The premium for insurance placed by or through a special lines’ surplus line broker pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the tax imposed upon the broker based upon gross premiums paid for insurance placed under authority conferred by the license.

(h) Special lines’ surplus line brokers may advertise and solicit in conformity with Section 1773, except that they are not subject to the limitation that any nonadmitted insurer’s name appearing in the advertisements or solicitations must be eligible under Section 1765.1.

*(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 83, Sec. 11. (AB 315) Effective July 15, 2011. Operative July 21, 2011, by Sec. 34 of Stats. 2011, Ch. 83.)*

*(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 83, Sec. 12. (AB 315) Effective July 15, 2011. Operative July 21, 2011, by Sec. 34 of Stats. 2011, Ch. 83.)*

(a) Except as provided in Sections 1760 and 1760.5, and paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b), a person within this state shall not transact any insurance for a home state insured with nonadmitted insurers, except by and through a surplus line broker licensed under this chapter and upon the terms and conditions prescribed in this chapter.

(b) (1) An insurer domiciled in California may have common directors with an affiliated nonadmitted insurer provided these common directors do not constitute the majority of the voting authority of the nonadmitted insurer and do not perform any management functions for the nonadmitted insurer in California.

(2) An insurer domiciled in California may perform the following administrative services on behalf of an affiliated nonadmitted insurer that has qualified as an eligible surplus line insurer pursuant to Section 1765.1:

(A) Computer operations that are unrelated to the underwriting process, which may include such activities as development and maintenance of application software, databases, and servers, procurement of information technology and services, network operations, and Internet Web site development and support.

(B) Clerical and administrative staffing support, provided that this staff shall not have any contact or interaction with policyholders of the nonadmitted insurer.

(C) Human resources, provided that any decisions relating to the hiring,
firing, disciplinary actions, or compensation of any employee, officer, or both, of the nonadmitted insurer shall be made directly by the nonadmitted insurer.

(D) Claims adjusting, as described in Section 14021, except that all claims notices, claims-related decisions, including those relating to setting reserves and claims acceptance, claim payments, and settlements shall be made directly by the affiliated nonadmitted insurer.

(E) Managing investments such as buying, maintaining, and selling financial investment instruments, except that decisions relating to investment goals, risk assumptions such as capital preservation and protection of investment principal, determining liquidity needs, and diversification ratios shall be made by the affiliated nonadmitted insurer.

(3) Nothing in this section permits the
nonadmitted insurer to conduct any activity through its affiliate that constitutes the transaction of insurance or a violation of Section 700 or 703.

*(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 83, Sec. 13. (AB 315) Effective July 15, 2011. Operative July 21, 2011, by Sec. 34 of Stats. 2011, Ch. 83.)*

###### [1762.](javascript:submitCodesValues('1762.','2.2.7','1999','255','3', 'id_2ed58e60-2920-11d9-a40c-fd27324936c4'))

For purposes of Sections 1764, 1764.1, and 1764.3, the term “certificate” means a surplus line broker certificate as defined in Section 48.

*(Added by Stats. 1999, Ch. 255, Sec. 3. Effective January 1, 2000.)*

###### [1763.](javascript:submitCodesValues('1763.','2.2.7','2012','162','104', 'id_bc440844-507f-11e2-acb2-82df319f281f'))

(a) A surplus line broker may solicit and place insurance for a home state insured, other than as excepted in Section 1761, with nonadmitted insurers only if that insurance cannot be procured from insurers admitted for the particular class or classes of insurance and that actually write the particular type of insurance in this state. Each surplus line broker shall be responsible to ensure that a diligent search is made among insurers that are admitted to transact and are actually writing the particular type of insurance in this state before procuring the insurance for a home state insured from a nonadmitted insurer. Each surplus line broker shall file with the commissioner or his or her designee, within 60 days of placing any insurance for a home state insured with a nonadmitted insurer, a written report that shall be kept
confidential, regarding the insurance. This report shall include the name and address of the insured, verification that the insured is a home state insured, the identity of the insurer or insurers, a description of the subject and location of the risk, the amount of premium charged for the insurance, a copy of the declarations page of the policy or a copy of the surplus line broker’s certificate or binder evidencing the placement of insurance, and other pertinent information that the commissioner may reasonably require. In addition, each surplus line broker shall file a standardized form to be prescribed by the commissioner setting forth the diligent efforts to place the coverage with admitted insurers and the results of these efforts. The form shall be signed by a person licensed under this code who has made the diligent search required by this section or who supervised an unlicensed person or persons who actually conducted the search. The insurance shall not be placed with a nonadmitted insurer for the
purpose of procuring a rate lower than the lowest rate that will be accepted by any admitted insurer except as provided by subdivision (c). The commissioner may make and publish reasonable rules and regulations, consistent with this chapter, in respect to transactions governed thereby and the basis or bases for his or her determinations hereunder.

(b) It shall be prima facie evidence that a diligent search among admitted insurers has been made if the standardized form filed as required by subdivision (a) establishes that three admitted insurers that actually write the particular type of insurance in this state have declined the risk, or that fewer than three admitted insurers actually write the particular type of insurance. The commissioner, or his or her designee, may review the form for the accuracy of the information provided on it, including, but not limited to, whether the listed insurers actually write that type of insurance, and whether
the three insurers declined the risk. The commissioner may take disciplinary action against the person signing the form for any misrepresentation made in the form due to the negligence of or the result of an intentional act by that person or the person or persons who actually conducted the search. Those actions may include any action authorized to be taken against a licensed person by this code. Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude the commissioner or his or her designee from directing the surplus line broker to conduct a further or additional search among admitted insurers for similar placements in the future.

(c) It shall be conclusively presumed that insurance is placed in violation of this section if the insurance is actually placed with a nonadmitted insurer at a lower rate of premium or lower premium than the lowest rate of premium or the lowest premium that could be obtained from an admitted insurer unless, at the time the
insurance attaches, there is filed with the commissioner a statement describing the insurance, specifying the rate and the nearest procurable rates from admitted insurers. The statement shall include an explanation of the reasons that the insurance must be placed with a nonadmitted insurer even though it is available from an admitted insurer. Unless the commissioner, or his or her designee, within five days after that filing notifies the filing broker that in his or her opinion the placing of the insurance constitutes a violation of this section, the broker may thereafter maintain in effect that insurance. If within that five-day period the commissioner notifies the surplus line broker that the insurance is in violation of this section and orders the broker to effect termination of that insurance within 10 days from the notice, and the broker fails or refuses to effect that termination, that failure or refusal is a violation of this section.

(d) Statements filed under this section are not subject to public inspection unless the commissioner determines that the public interest or the welfare of the filing broker requires that any statement be made public.

(e) For purposes of this section, “type of insurance” means the hazard or combination of hazards covered by a contract of insurance.

(f) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), this section shall not apply to insurance issued or delivered in this state to a home state insured by a nonadmitted Mexican insurer by and through a surplus line broker affording coverage exclusively in the Republic of Mexico on property located temporarily or permanently in, or operations conducted temporarily or permanently within, the Republic of Mexico.

(g) This section does not apply to the extension of coverage by a
nonadmitted insurer, of or for the same risks, and to the same insured under an existing surplus lines policy. Such an extension may not exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any 12-month period. The extension may not include a change in coverage, terms, and conditions, or limits. Any additional premium charged for the extension shall be determined pro rata, based on the same rate of premium as the existing surplus lines policy.

(h) (1) The diligent search requirement set forth in subdivision (a) shall not apply to a commercial insured as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1760.1 when both of the following occur:

(A) The surplus line broker procuring or placing the surplus line insurance has disclosed in writing to the commercial insured that surplus insurance may or may not be available from the admitted market that may provide greater protection with
more regulatory oversight.

(B) The commercial insured has subsequently requested in writing that the surplus line broker procure or place surplus insurance from a nonadmitted insurer.

(2) The surplus line broker shall be responsible to ensure that the applicant is a commercial insured. A surplus line broker who reasonably relies on information provided in good faith by the applicant, whether directly or through a producer, shall be deemed to be in compliance with this requirement.

*(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 162, Sec. 104. (SB 1171) Effective January 1, 2013.)*

###### [1763.1.](javascript:submitCodesValues('1763.1.','2.2.7','2017','477','1', 'id_b85eb466-db6a-11e7-8ae0-bddf6e708bba'))

(a) The commissioner may by order declare permissible for placement for a home state insured with a nonadmitted insurer and exempt from all requirements of Section 1763 except the filing of a confidential written report, any type of insurance coverage or risk for which he or she finds, after a public hearing, that there is not a reasonable or adequate market among admitted insurers or that the type of coverage is for new, innovative products for which a reasonable or adequate market among admitted insurers has not had time to develop. The commissioner or his or her designee shall maintain an export list showing all those exempt coverages and risks. Additions to the export list may be made after a hearing, which may take place one or more
times each year as deemed necessary by the commissioner. A public hearing shall be held annually or more often at the commissioner’s discretion and reasonable notice of a hearing shall be given to all interested parties including surplus line brokers, admitted insurers, trade associations representing admitted insurers, agents and brokers, and consumer groups. The hearing and findings shall not be required to be conducted in accordance with Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. An order by the commissioner shall continue in effect until terminated by the commissioner. Where the commissioner receives written
comments or testimony or otherwise determines, prior to a hearing, that a type of insurance on the export list is more available, in the admitted market, the commissioner may remove the type of insurance from the list. The permissibility of any type of insurance to remain on the list is subject to an annual affirmative finding by the commissioner, however, when written comment or testimony is received prior to a hearing, the permissibility of that type of insurance to remain on the export list shall be reviewed at the next hearing and that type of insurance may not remain on the export list without an affirmative decision by the commissioner or his or her designee that there is not a reasonable or adequate market among admitted insurers.

In fulfillment of this responsibility, the nonadmitted insurer and the surplus line broker may rely, if it is reasonable under all the circumstances to do so, on the disclosure statement received from a licensee involved in the transaction as prima facie evidence
that the disclosure statement and appropriate signature from the applicant have been obtained. The surplus line broker shall maintain a copy of the signed disclosure statement in the broker’s records for a period of at least five years. These records shall be made available to the commissioner and the insured upon request.

(b) The following notice shall be provided to home state insureds and home state insured applicants for insurance as provided by subdivision (a), and shall be printed in English and in the language principally used by the surplus line broker and nonadmitted insurer to
advertise, solicit, or negotiate the sale and purchase of surplus line insurance. The surplus line broker and nonadmitted insurer shall use the appropriate bracketed language for application and issued policy disclosures:

# “IMPORTANT NOTICE:

1. The insurance policy that you [have purchased] [are applying to purchase] is being issued by an insurer that is not licensed by the State of California. These companies are called “nonadmitted” or “surplus line” insurers.

2. The insurer is not subject to the financial solvency regulation and enforcement that apply to California licensed insurers.

3. The insurer does not participate in any of the insurance guarantee funds created
by California law. Therefore, these funds will not pay your claims or protect your assets if the insurer becomes insolvent and is unable to make payments as promised.

4. The insurer should be licensed either as a foreign insurer in another state in the United States or as a non-United States (alien) insurer. You should ask questions of your insurance agent, broker, or “surplus line” broker or contact the California Department of Insurance at the toll-free number 1-800-927-4357 or internet website www.insurance.ca.gov. Ask whether or not the insurer is licensed as a foreign or non-United States (alien) insurer and for additional information about the insurer. You may also visit the NAIC’s internet website at www.naic.org. The NAIC—the National Association of Insurance Commissioners—is the regulatory support organization created and
governed by the chief insurance regulators in the United States.

5. Foreign insurers should be licensed by a state in the United States and you may contact that state’s department of insurance to obtain more information about that insurer. You can find a link to each state from this NAIC internet website: https://naic.org/state\_web\_map.htm.

6. For non-United States (alien) insurers, the insurer should be licensed by a country outside of the United States and should be on the NAIC’s International Insurers Department (IID) listing of approved nonadmitted non-United States insurers. Ask your agent, broker, or “surplus line” broker to obtain more information about that
insurer.

7. California maintains a “List of Approved Surplus Line Insurers (LASLI).” Ask your agent or broker if the insurer is on that list, or view that list at the internet website of the California Department of Insurance: www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/120-company/07-lasli/lasli.cfm.

8. If you, as the applicant, required that the insurance policy you have purchased be effective immediately, either because existing coverage was going to lapse within two business days or because you were required to have coverage within two business days, and you did not receive this disclosure form and a request for your signature until after coverage became effective, you have
the right to cancel this policy within five days of receiving this disclosure. If you cancel coverage, the premium will be prorated and any broker’s fee charged for this insurance will be returned to you.”

  

(c) When a contract is issued to an industrial insured, neither the nonadmitted insurer nor the surplus line broker is required to provide the notice required in this section except on the confirmation of insurance, the certificate of placement, or the policy, whichever is first provided to the insured, nor is the insurer or surplus line broker required to obtain the insured’s signature. The producer shall ensure that the notice affixed to the confirmation of insurance, certificate of placement, or the policy is provided to the insured. The producer shall insert the current toll-free telephone number of the Department of Insurance as provided in paragraph 4 of the notice.

(1) An industrial insured is an insured that does both of the following:

(A) Employs at least 25 employees on average during the prior 12 months.

(B) Has aggregate annual premiums for insurance for all risks other than workers’ compensation and health coverage totaling no less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or obtains insurance through the services of a full-time employee acting as an insurance manager or a continuously retained insurance consultant. A “continuously retained insurance consultant” does not include: (i) an agent or broker through whom the insurance is being placed, (ii) a subagent or subproducer involved in the transaction, or (iii) an agent or broker that is a business organization employing or contracting with a person mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii).

(2) The surplus line broker shall be responsible for ensuring that the applicant is an industrial insured. A surplus line broker who reasonably relies on information provided in good faith by the applicant, whether directly or through the producer, shall be deemed to be in compliance with this requirement.

(d) For purposes of compliance with the requirement of subdivision (a) that the signature of the applicant be obtained, the following shall apply:

(1) If the insurance transaction is not conducted at an in-person, face-to-face meeting, the applicant’s signature on the disclosure form may be transmitted by the applicant to the agent or broker via facsimile or comparable electronic transmittal.

(2) In the case of commercial lines coverage, or personal
insurance coverage subject to Section 675 and any umbrella coverage associated therewith, where an applicant requires that insurance coverage be bound immediately, either because existing coverage will lapse within two business days of the time the insurance is bound or because the applicant is required to have coverage in place within two business days, and the applicant cannot meet in person with the agent or broker to sign the disclosure form, the agent or broker may obtain the signature of the applicant within five days of binding coverage, provided that the applicant may cancel the insurance so placed within five days of receiving the disclosure form from the agent or broker. The cancellation shall be on a pro rata basis, and the applicant shall be entitled to the rescission or return of any broker’s fees charged for the placement. When a policy is canceled, the broker shall inform the applicant that the broker’s fee must be returned and that the premium must be prorated.

(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), this section shall not apply to insurance issued or delivered in this state by a nonadmitted Mexican insurer by and through a surplus line broker affording coverage exclusively in the Republic of Mexico on property located temporarily or permanently in, or operations conducted temporarily or permanently within, the Republic of Mexico.

(a) A photostatic copy of evidence that the insurance has been bound.

A surplus line broker may place any coverage with a California-approved nonadmitted insurer if the insurer is domiciled in the Republic of Mexico and the placement covers only liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle, aircraft, or boat in the Republic of Mexico, or if, at the time of placement, the nonadmitted insurer meets the following requirements:

(a) (1) Has established its financial stability, reputation, and integrity, for the class of insurance the broker proposes to place, by satisfactory evidence submitted to the commissioner through a surplus line broker.

(2) Meets one of the following requirements with respect to its financial stability:

(A) Has capital and surplus that together total at least forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000). “Capital” shall be as defined in Section 36. “Surplus” shall be defined as assets exceeding the sum of liabilities for losses reported, expenses, taxes, and all other indebtedness and reinsurance of outstanding risks as provided by law and paid-in capital in the case of an insurer issuing or having outstanding shares of capital stock. The type of assets to be used in calculating capital and surplus shall be as follows: at least twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) shall be in the form of cash, or securities of the same character and quality as specified in Sections 1170 to 1182, inclusive, or in readily marketable securities listed on regulated United States’ national or principal regional securities exchanges. The remaining assets shall be in the form just described or in the form of investments of substantially the same character and quality
as described in Sections 1190 to 1202, inclusive. In calculating capital and surplus under this section, the term “same character and quality” shall permit, but not require, the commissioner to approve assets maintained in accordance with the laws of another state or country. The commissioner shall be guided by the limitations, restrictions, or other requirements of this code or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual in determining whether assets substantially similar to those described in Sections 1190 to 1202, inclusive, qualify. The commissioner shall retain the discretion to disapprove or disallow an asset that is not of a sound quality, or that he or she deems to create an unacceptable risk of loss to the insurer or to policyholders. Letters of credit shall not qualify as assets in the calculation of surplus. If capital and surplus together total less than forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000), the commissioner has affirmatively found that the
capital and surplus are adequate to protect California policyholders. The commissioner shall consider, on determining whether to make this finding, factors such as quality of management, the capital and surplus of a parent company, the underwriting profit and investment income trends, and the record of claims payment and claims handling practices of the nonadmitted insurer.

(B) In the case of an “Insurance Exchange” created and authorized under the laws of individual states, maintains capital and surplus of not less than fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) in the aggregate. “Capital” shall be as defined in Section 36. “Surplus” shall be defined as assets exceeding the sum of liabilities for losses reported, expenses, taxes, and all other indebtedness and reinsurance of outstanding risks as provided by law and paid-in capital in the case of an insurer issuing or having outstanding shares of capital stock. The type of assets to be used in
calculating capital and surplus shall be as follows: at least twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) shall be in the form of cash, or securities of the same character and quality as specified in Sections 1170 to 1182, inclusive, or in readily marketable securities listed on regulated United States’ national or principal regional securities exchanges. The remaining assets shall be in the form just described or in the form of investments of substantially the same character and quality as described in Sections 1190 to 1202, inclusive. In calculating capital and surplus under this section, the term “same character and quality” shall permit, but not require, the commissioner to approve assets maintained in accordance with the laws of another state or country. The commissioner shall be guided by the limitations, restrictions, or other requirements of this code or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual in determining whether assets substantially similar to
those described in Sections 1190 to 1202, inclusive, qualify. The commissioner shall retain the discretion to disapprove or disallow an asset that is not of a sound quality, or that he or she deems to create an unacceptable risk of loss to the insurer or to policyholders. Letters of credit shall not qualify as assets in the calculation of surplus. Each individual syndicate seeking to accept surplus line placements of risks resident, located, or to be performed in this state shall maintain minimum capital and surplus of not less than six million four hundred thousand dollars ($6,400,000). Each individual syndicate shall increase the capital and surplus required by this paragraph by one million dollars ($1,000,000) each year until it attains a capital and surplus of forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000).

(C) In the case of a syndicate that is part of a group consisting of incorporated individual insurers, or a combination of both incorporated
and unincorporated insurers, that at all times maintains a trust fund of not less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in a qualified United States financial institution as security to the full amount thereof for the United States surplus line policyholders and beneficiaries of direct policies of the group, including all policyholders and beneficiaries of direct policies of the syndicate, and the full balance in the trust fund is available to satisfy the liabilities of each member of the group of those syndicates, incorporated individual insurers or other unincorporated insurers, without regard to their individual contributions to that trust fund, and the trust complies with the terms of and conditions specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), the syndicate is excepted from the capital and surplus requirements of subparagraph (A). The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level
of solvency regulation and control by the group’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

(b) (1) In addition, to be approved as a surplus line insurer, an insurer not domiciled in one of the United States or its territories shall have in force in the United States an irrevocable trust account in a qualified United States financial institution, for the protection of United States policyholders, of not less than five million four hundred thousand dollars ($5,400,000) and consisting of cash, securities acceptable to the commissioner that are authorized pursuant to Sections 1170 to 1182, inclusive, readily marketable securities acceptable to the commissioner that are listed on a regulated United States national or principal regional security exchange, or clean and irrevocable letters of credit acceptable to the commissioner and issued by a qualified United States financial institution. The trust agreement
shall be in a form acceptable to the commissioner. The funds in the trust account may be included in any calculation of capital and surplus, except letters of credit, which shall not be included in the calculation.

(2) In the case of a syndicate seeking approval under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), the syndicate shall, in addition to the requirements of that subparagraph, at a minimum, maintain in the United States a trust account in an amount satisfactory to the commissioner that is not less than the amount required by the domiciliary state of the syndicate’s trust. The trust account shall comply with the terms and conditions specified in paragraph (1).

(3) In the case of a group of incorporated insurers under common administration that maintains a trust fund of not less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in a qualified United States financial
institution for the payment of claims of its United States policyholders, their assigns, or successors in interest and that complies with the terms and conditions of paragraph (1) that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years, that is in good standing with its domiciliary regulator, whose individual insurer members maintain standards and a financial condition reasonably comparable to admitted insurers, that submits to this state’s authority to examine its books and bears the expense of examination, and that has an aggregate policyholder surplus of ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000), the group is excepted from the capital and surplus requirements of subdivision (a).

(c) Unless available from the NAIC or other public source, has caused to be provided to the commissioner the following documents:

(1) The financial
documents as specified below, each showing the insurer’s condition as of a date not more than 12 months prior to submission:

(A) A copy of an annual statement, prepared in the form prescribed by the NAIC. For an alien insurer, in lieu of an annual statement, a licensee may submit a form as set forth by regulation and as prepared by the insurer, and, if listed by the IID, a copy of the complete information as required in the application for listing by the IID.

(B) A copy of an audited financial report on the insurer’s condition that meets the standards of subparagraph (D) for foreign insurers or subparagraph (E) for alien insurers.

(C) If the insurer is an alien:

(i) A certified copy of the trust agreement referenced in subdivision (b).

(ii) A verified copy of the most recent quarterly statement or list of the assets in the trust.

(iii) An audited financial report shall be prepared by an independent certified public accountant or accounting firm in good standing with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in all states where licensed to practice; and be prepared in conformity with
statutory accounting practices prescribed, or otherwise permitted, by the insurance regulator of the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction.

(v) An audited financial report shall be prepared in a form and using language and groupings substantially the same as the relevant sections of the insurer’s annual statement filed with its domiciliary jurisdiction, and presenting comparatively the amounts as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year and the amounts as of December 31 of the preceding year.

(E) Financial reports filed pursuant to this section by alien insurers shall
conform to the following standards:

(i) Except as provided in clause (ii) of subparagraph (C), financial documents should be certified. If certification of a financial document is not available, the document shall be verified.

(ii) Financial documents should be expressed in United States dollars, but may be expressed in another currency, if the exchange rate for the other currency as of the date of the document is also provided.

(iii) The responses provided pursuant to subparagraph (A) on the form submitted in lieu of an annual statement should follow the most recent Insurance Solvency International Guide to Alien Reporting Format, “Standard Definitions of Accounting Items.” Responses that do not agree with a standard definition shall be fully explained in the form.

(iv) An audited financial report shall be prepared by an independent licensed auditor in the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction or in any state.

(v) An audited financial report shall be prepared in accord with either (I) Generally Accepted Auditing Standards that prescribe Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or (II) International Accounting Standards as published and revised from time to time by the International Auditing Guidelines published by the International Auditing Practice Committee of the International Federation of Accountants, and shall include financial statement notes and a summary of significant accounting practices.

(F) The commissioner may accept, in lieu of a document described above, a certified or verified financial or regulatory document, statement, or report if the commissioner finds that it
possesses reliability and financial detail substantially equal to or greater than the document for which it is proposed to be a substitute.

(G) If one of the financial documents required to be submitted under subparagraphs (A) and (B) is dated within 12 months of submission, but the other document is not so dated, the licensee may use the outdated document if it is accompanied by a supplement. The supplement must meet the same requirements that apply to the supplemented document and must update the outdated document to a date within the prescribed time period, preferably to the same date as the nonsupplemented document.

(2) A certified copy of the insurer’s license issued by its domiciliary jurisdiction, plus a certification of good standing, certificate of compliance, or other equivalent certificate, from either that jurisdiction or, if the jurisdiction does not issue those
certificates, from a state where it is licensed.

(3) Information on the insurer’s agent in California for service of process, including the agent’s full name and address. The agent’s address must include a street address where the agent can be reached during normal business hours.

(4) The complete street address, mailing address, and telephone number of the insurer’s principal place of business.

(5) A certified or verified explanation, report, or other statement from the insurance regulatory office or official of the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction concerning the insurer’s record regarding market conduct and consumer complaints, or, if that information cannot be obtained from that jurisdiction, then any other information that the licensee can procure to demonstrate a good reputation for payment of claims and
treatment of policyholders.

(6) A verified statement, from the insurer or licensee, on whether the insurer or an affiliated entity is currently known to be the subject of an order or proceeding regarding conservation, liquidation, or other receivership; or regarding revocation or suspension of a license to transact insurance in any jurisdiction; or otherwise seeking to stop the insurer from transacting insurance in any jurisdiction. The statement shall identify the proceeding by date, jurisdiction, and relief or sanction sought, and shall attach a copy of the relevant order.

(7) A certified copy of the most recent report of examination or an explanation if the report is not available.

(8) A list of all California surplus line brokers authorized by the insurer to issue policies on its behalf, and any additions to or
deletions from that list.

(d) (1) Has provided additional information or documentation required by the commissioner that is relevant to the financial stability, reputation, and integrity of the nonadmitted insurer. In making a determination concerning financial stability, reputation, and integrity of the nonadmitted insurer, the commissioner shall consider any analyses, findings, or conclusions made by the NAIC in its review of the insurer for purposes of inclusion on or exclusion from the list of authorized nonadmitted insurers maintained by the NAIC. The commissioner may, but shall not be required to, rely on, adopt, or otherwise accept any analyses, findings, or conclusions of the NAIC, as the commissioner deems appropriate. In the case of a syndicate seeking eligibility under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), the commissioner may, but shall not be required to, rely on, adopt, or otherwise accept any
analyses, findings, or conclusions of a state, as the commissioner deems appropriate, as long as that state, in its method of regulation and review, meets the requirements of paragraph (2).

(2) The regulatory body of the state shall regularly receive and review the following: (A) an audited financial statement of the syndicate, prepared by a certified or chartered public accountant; (B) an opinion of a qualified actuary with regard to the syndicate’s aggregate reserves for payment of losses or claims and payment of expenses of adjustment or settlement of losses or claims; (C) a certification from the qualified United States financial institution that acts as the syndicate’s trustee, respecting the existence and value of the syndicate’s trust fund; and (D) information concerning the syndicate’s or its manager’s operating history, business plan, ownership and control, experience, and ability, together with any other pertinent factors, and any
information indicating that the syndicate or its manager make reasonably prompt payment of claims in this state or elsewhere. The regulatory body of the state shall have the authority, either by law or through the operation of a valid and enforceable agreement, to review the syndicate’s assets and liabilities and audit the syndicate’s trust account, and shall exercise that authority with a frequency and in a manner satisfactory to the commissioner.

(e) Has established that:

(1) All documents required by subdivisions (c) and (d) have been filed. Each of the documents appear after review to be complete, clear, comprehensible, unambiguous, accurate, and consistent.

(2) The documents affirm that the insurer is not subject in any jurisdiction to an order or proceeding that:

(A) Seeks to stop it from transacting insurance.

(B) Relates to conservation, liquidation, or other receivership.

(C) Relates to revocation or suspension of its license.

(3) The documents affirm that the insurer has actively transacted insurance for the three years immediately preceding the filing made under this section, unless an exemption is granted. As used in this paragraph, “insurer” does not include a syndicate of underwriting entities. The commissioner may grant an exemption if the licensee has applied for exemption and demonstrates either of the following:

(A) The insurer meets the condition for any exception set forth in subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section 716.

(B) If the insurer has been actively transacting insurance for at least 12 months, and the licensee demonstrates that the exemption is warranted because the insurer’s current financial strength, operating history, business plan, ownership and control, management experience, and ability, together with any other pertinent factors, make three years of active insurance transaction unnecessary to establish sufficient reputation.

(4) The documents confirm that the insurer holds a license to issue insurance policies, other than reinsurance, to residents of the jurisdiction that granted the license unless an exemption is granted. The commissioner may grant an exemption if the licensee has applied for an exemption and demonstrates that the exemption is warranted because the insurer proposes to issue in California only commercial coverage, and is wholly owned and actually controlled by
substantial and knowledgeable business enterprises that are its policyholders and that effectively govern the insurer’s destiny in furtherance of their own business objectives.

(5) The information filed pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) or otherwise filed with or available to the commissioner, including reports received from California policyholders, shall indicate that the insurer makes reasonably prompt payment of claims in this state or elsewhere.

(6) The information available to the commissioner shall not indicate that the insurer offers in California a licensee products or rates that violate any provision of this code.

(f) Has been placed on the list of approved surplus line insurers by the commissioner. The commissioner shall establish a list of all surplus line insurers that have met the
requirements of subdivisions (a) to (e), inclusive, and shall publish a master list at least semiannually. An insurer receiving approval as an approved surplus line insurer shall be added by addendum to the list at the time of approval, and shall be incorporated into the master list at the next date of publication. If an insurer appears on the most recent list, it shall be presumed that the insurer is an approved surplus line insurer, unless the commissioner or his or her designee has mailed or causes to be mailed notice to all surplus line brokers that the commissioner has withdrawn the insurer’s approval. Upon receipt of notice, the surplus line broker shall no longer advertise that the insurer is approved. Nothing in this subdivision shall limit the commissioner’s discretion to withdraw an insurer’s approval.

(g) (1) Except as provided by paragraph (2), whenever the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe, and
determines after a public hearing, that an insurer on the list established pursuant to subdivision (f), (A) is in an unsound financial condition, (B) does not meet the approval requirements under subdivisions (a) to (e), inclusive, (C) has violated the laws of this state, or (D) without justification, or with a frequency so as to indicate a general business practice, delays the payment of just claims, the commissioner may issue an order removing the insurer from the list. Notice of hearing shall be served upon the insurer or its agent for service of process stating the time and place of the hearing and the conduct, condition, or ground upon which the commissioner would make his or her order. The hearing shall occur not less than 20 days, nor more than 30 days, after notice is served upon the insurer or its agent for service of process.

(2) If the commissioner determines that an insurer’s immediate removal from the list is necessary to protect
the public or a home state insured or home state insured applicant of the insurer, or, in the case of an application by an insurer to be placed on the list that is being denied by the commissioner, the commissioner may issue an order pursuant to paragraph (1) without prior notice and hearing. At the time an order is served pursuant to this paragraph to an insurer on the list, the commissioner shall also issue and serve upon the insurer a statement of the reasons that immediate removal is necessary. An order issued pursuant to this paragraph shall include a notice stating the time and place of a hearing on the order, which shall be not less than 20 days, nor more than 30 days, after the notice is served.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), in a case where the commissioner is basing a decision to remove an insurer from the list, or deny an application to be placed on the list, on the failure of the insurer or applicant to comply with,
meet, or maintain any of the objective criteria established by this section, or by regulation adopted pursuant to this section, the commissioner may specify this fact in the order, and a hearing shall not be required to be held on the order.

(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the commissioner may, without prior notice or hearing, remove from the list established pursuant to subdivision (f) an insurer that has failed or refused to timely provide documents required by this section, or regulations adopted to implement this section. In the case of removal pursuant to this paragraph, the commissioner shall notify all surplus line brokers of the action.

(h) In addition to other statements or reports required by this chapter, the commissioner may also address to a licensee a written request for full and complete information respecting the financial stability, reputation, and
integrity of a nonadmitted insurer with whom the licensee has dealt or proposes to deal in the transaction of insurance business with a home state insured. The licensee so addressed shall promptly furnish in written or printed form so much of the information requested as he or she can produce, together with a signed statement identifying the same and giving reasons for omissions, if any. After due examination of the information and accompanying statement, the commissioner may, if he or she believes it to be in the public interest, advise the licensee in writing that the insurer does not qualify as an approved insurer. Any placement in the nonadmitted insurer made by a licensee after receipt of that advisement shall be accompanied by a copy of the advisement. The commissioner may issue an advisement when documents submitted pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d) do not meet the criteria of subdivisions (a) to (e), inclusive, or when the commissioner obtains documents on an insurer and the insurer does not meet
the criteria of subdivisions (a) to (e), inclusive, and shall be authorized to not include or remove that insurer from the List of Approved Surplus Line Insurers.

(i) The commissioner shall require, at least annually, the submission of records and statements reasonably necessary to ensure that the requirements of this section are maintained.

(j) The schedule of fees to cover the costs of administering and enforcing this chapter are as follows:

(1) Initial application, six thousand one hundred thirteen dollars ($6,113).

(2) Renewal application, three thousand fifty-seven dollars ($3,057).

(3) Financial update, three hundred forty-one dollars ($341).

(4) Nonfinancial update, fifty dollars ($50).

The surplus line broker who is required to include the policy in his or her own statement is either (1) the one who is responsible for negotiating, effecting the placement, remitting the premium to the nonadmitted insurer or its representatives, and filing the confidential written report pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1763, or (2) the one surplus line broker who is delegated the responsibility for the filing of the confidential written report pursuant to
subdivision (a) of Section 1763 pursuant to a written agreement that is (A) by and among the surplus line brokers referenced in paragraph (1) and this paragraph involved in the transaction, (B) signed by the surplus line brokers referenced in paragraph (1) and this paragraph involved in the transaction, and (C) provides by its terms that the agreement shall be made available to the commissioner or his or her designee, upon request.

(c) The date on which the surplus line broker transacting a policy prepares a bill or invoice for payment of all or part of the premiums due, shall be considered the date on which that business was done or transacted, subject to subdivision (d). This date shall be shown on the face of the bill or invoice and shall be
referred to as the “invoice date.”

(d) (1) The invoice date shall be no more than 60 days after the policy effective date and no more than 60 days after the insurance was placed with a nonadmitted insurer, except as provided in paragraph (2).

(2) For purposes of this chapter, the amount of gross premium to be reported, if premiums are billed and payable in installments, shall be the amount of the installment premium, provided the amount and due date of each installment, or the basis for determining each installment, is identifiable in the policy or an endorsement, and either of the following conditions is satisfied:

(A) Installments under the policy are not billed more frequently than once per month.

(B) If more than one
installment is billed in any month, the commissioner determines, in his or her discretion, that the installment billing method used does not unduly burden the commissioner’s ability to accurately determine the amount of premium paid by the insured.

(3) If a new or renewal policy has an effective date between January 1, 2011, to July 20, 2011, inclusive, and is placed on or before July 20, 2011, then the policy shall be considered to be business done by the surplus line broker as of the effective date. If a new or renewal policy has an effective date between January 1, 2011, to July 20, 2011, inclusive, then the policy shall be considered to be business done by the home state insured who directly procures policies as of the effective date. Cancellations or endorsements shall be business done on the same date as the policy that is being canceled or endorsed, if that policy effective date is on or before July 20, 2011. Installment premiums, as
referenced in paragraph (2), shall be business done on the date of the most recent invoice issued on or before July 20, 2011, that included premium tax charges. This paragraph is enacted to address the July 21, 2011, effective date of the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203), and shall remain in effect only until October 18, 2012.

(a) The amount of the payment shall be 3 percent of the gross premiums charged less return premiums upon business done by the surplus line broker during the calendar month ending two calendar months immediately preceding the due date of the payment, as specified in Section 1775.3, excluding gross premiums and return premiums paid by him or her upon business governed by the provisions of Section 1760.5. If during any calendar month those return premiums upon business done by a surplus line broker exceed the gross premiums upon the business done by him or her in that calendar month, then no payment shall be payable by him or her in respect to that calendar month, and he or she may carry forward that excess to the next succeeding calendar month or
months and apply it in reduction of the taxable premiums on business done by him or her in that succeeding calendar month or months. Even though no payment shall be payable by the broker, he or she shall file a return showing that his or her return premiums exceeded his or her gross premiums.

(b) In determining the applicability of subdivision (a) of Section 1775.1 to a surplus line broker who has acquired the business of another surplus line broker, the amount of tax liability of the acquired broker for the immediately preceding calendar year shall be added to the amount of the tax liability of the acquiring broker for the immediately preceding calendar year.

(c) All amounts paid, other than penalties and interest, shall be allowed as a credit on the annual tax imposed by Section 1775.5.

(d) If the total amount of
monthly installment payments for any calendar year exceeds the amount of annual tax for that year, the excess shall be treated as an overpayment of annual tax and be allowed as a credit or refund.

(e) A penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the monthly payment due shall be levied upon and paid by any surplus line broker who fails to make the necessary payment within the time required, plus interest at the rate of 1 percent per calendar month or fraction thereof from the due date of the payment until the date payment is received by the commissioner, but not for any period after the due date of the annual tax. The penalty and interest shall be applied as prescribed in Section 12636.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The commissioner may remit the penalty in a case where he or she finds, as a result of examination or otherwise, that the failure of, or delay in, payment arose out of excusable mistake or excusable inadvertence.

(f) For any part of a payment required that was not made within the time required by law, when the nonpayment or late payment was due to fraud on the part of the taxpayer, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount unpaid shall be added thereto, in addition to all other penalties otherwise imposed.

(g) The commissioner, upon a showing of good cause, may extend for not to exceed 10 days the time for making a monthly payment. The extension may be granted at any time, provided that a request therefor is filed with the commissioner within or prior to the period for which the extension may be granted. Any surplus line broker to whom an extension is granted shall, in addition to the monthly payment, pay interest at the rate of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the due date until the annual tax due date.

(a) Every surplus line broker shall annually, on or before the first day of March of each year, pay to the Insurance Commissioner for the use of the State of California a tax of 3 percent of the gross premiums charged less return premiums upon business done by him or her under the authority of his or her license during the preceding calendar year, excluding any portions of premiums upon business done involving the risk finance portion of any blended finite risk product used in the financing element of state or federal Superfund environmental settlements involving remediation of soil or groundwater contamination or by the provisions of Section 1760.5. If during any calendar year 3 percent of the return premiums upon business done by a surplus line broker exceed 3 percent of the gross premiums upon that business done by him or her
in that year, then he or she may either carry forward that excess to the next succeeding year and apply it as a credit against 3 percent of gross premiums on the business done by him or her in the succeeding year, or he or she may elect to receive, and thereupon be paid a refund equal to the amount of taxes theretofore paid by him or her on that excess of return premiums paid over gross premiums received.

(b) For the purpose of determining that tax, the total premium charged for all that nonadmitted insurance placed in a single transaction with one underwriter or group of underwriters, whether in one or more policies, shall be the entire premium charged on all nonadmitted insurance for the California home state insured. This provision shall not apply to interstate motor transit operations conducted between this and other states. With respect to those operations surplus line tax shall be payable on the entire premium charged on all nonadmitted
insurance, less the following:

(2) The premium for any operations outside of this state of an insured who maintains a headquarters operating office outside of this state and a branch office in this state.

(c) (1) A penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the payment due pursuant to this section shall be levied upon and paid by any surplus line broker who fails to make the necessary payment within the time required, plus interest at the rate of 1 percent per calendar month or fraction thereof, from March 1, the due date of the annual tax, until the date the payment
is received by the commissioner. The penalty and interest shall be applied as prescribed in Section 12636.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The commissioner, upon a showing of good cause, may extend for a period not to exceed 30 days, the time for filing a tax return or paying any amount required to be paid with the return. The extension may be granted at any time, provided that a request therefor is filed with the commissioner within, or prior to, the period for which the extension may be granted.

(2) Any surplus line broker to whom an extension is granted shall, in addition to the tax, pay interest at the rate of 1 percent per month or fraction thereof from March 1, until the date of payment. The commissioner may remit the penalty in a case where the commissioner finds, as a result of examination or otherwise, that the failure of or delay in payment arose out of excusable mistake or excusable inadvertence.

(d) For any part of a payment required by this section or by Section 1775.4 which was not made within the time required by law, when the nonpayment or late payment was due to fraud on the part of the broker, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount unpaid shall be added thereto, in addition to all other penalties otherwise imposed.

(e) For the purposes of this section,
these terms shall have the following meanings:

(1) “Blended finite risk product” means a contractual arrangement combining risk finance with traditional risk transfer, where a distinct portion of the program cost represents the funding of a known, existing, nonfortuitous future cost, obligation, responsibility, or liability at its discounted net present value, and another portion of the program cost represents risk transfer for losses that have yet to occur related to the cost, obligation, responsibility, or liability that is the subject of the program.

(2) “Risk financing” means that portion of any blended finite risk product that represents the funding of a known, existing, nonfortuitous future cost, obligation, responsibility, or liability.

(3) “Risk finance” or “financing element” means a method of
funding for a known future cost over a long time horizon in current-value dollars using the principle of net present value discounting.
