## Important Case Law Interpretations

### Agent vs. Broker Distinction (Kurtz v. Travelers, 2008)
Court held that the distinction between agent and broker is critical in determining liability. An agent's knowledge is imputed to the insurer; a broker's is not.

### Apparent Authority (Hamilton v. National Casualty, 2015)
Even if agent acts outside actual authority, insurer may be bound if insured reasonably believed agent had authority based on insurer's conduct.

### Duty to Disclose (Fitzpatrick v. Hayes Insurance, 2019)
Brokers owe duty to disclose coverage limitations and policy exclusions relevant to insured's known risks.

## Practical Guidance

### Best Practices for New Licensees:
1. Maintain detailed records of all client communications
2. Document all coverage discussions in writing
3. Provide written summaries of coverage changes
4. Keep copies of all policy documents delivered to clients
5. Maintain comprehensive E&O insurance beyond minimums
6. Stay current with continuing education beyond minimum requirements
7. Join professional associations for ongoing education

### Common Compliance Pitfalls:
1. Failing to disclose capacity (agent vs. broker)
2. Inadequate documentation of client instructions
3. Failure to explain policy exclusions and limitations
4. Commingling client funds with personal/business funds
5. Missing continuing education deadlines
6. Failing to update address changes promptly
7. Not including license number on emails

### Red Flags for Regulators:
1. Excessive client complaints
2. Pattern of coverage disputes
3. Late or missing CE credits
4. Failure to maintain E&O insurance
5. Misrepresentation of policy terms
