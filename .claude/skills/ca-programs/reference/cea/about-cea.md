How We’re Governed

## Public Management and Governance

CEA is publicly managed by a governing board of five elected officials that govern and conduct the affairs of CEA’s earthquake insurance business and provide independent oversight of CEA’s operations. Additionally, an 11-member advisory panel made up of property insurers, insurance agents, and public members provides guidance and support to CEA, ensuring our earthquake insurance policyholders are receiving the best product on the market. These boards, along with CEA’s Executive Management Team—whose leaders have a rich history in diverse public industries—make up a strong foundation of leadership at CEA.
