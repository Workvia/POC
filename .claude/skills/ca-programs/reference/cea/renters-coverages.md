| Emergency Repairs | Included | Covers earthquake-damage repairs that are needed to protect your personal property from further damage (example: if there is a hole in your roof and you have to buy a tarp to cover your personal belongings to protect them from a rainstorm). |
| Coverage Limits | $1,000 or 5% of Personal Property coverage | If your rented house, apartment or room is damaged by an earthquake, Emergency Repairs will cover up to $1,000 to protect your personal belongings from further damage. |
