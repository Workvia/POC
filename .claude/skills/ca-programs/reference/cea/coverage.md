# CEA Earthquake Insurance: Policy Forms and Coverage Options

## Policy Types

The California Earthquake Authority (CEA) offers two main policy types for homeowners:

### 1. Standard Policy
- All coverages bundled together under one combined deductible
- Simpler structure with unified deductible application
- Personal property coverage is automatically included
- All limits and deductibles apply uniformly across all coverage types

### 2. Homeowners Choice Policy
The Homeowners Choice policy provides greater flexibility in coverage selection:

#### Key Features:
- **Separate Deductibles**: Choose different deductibles for dwelling (Coverage A) and personal property (Coverage C)
- **Optional Coverages**: May choose to purchase only dwelling coverage and decline other coverages
- **Deductible Waiver Provision**: If covered damage to your house exceeds the dwelling deductible, CEA waives the personal property deductible for the same earthquake claim

#### Coverage Flexibility:
- Purchase all coverages together under one deductible (like Standard policy), OR
- Select separate deductibles for dwelling and personal property
- Option to forgo personal property coverage entirely (not available in Standard policy)

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Standard Policy
- Dwelling Coverage: $500,000
- Deductible: 15%
- Personal Property: $25,000
- Earthquake damage: $100,000 to dwelling, $15,000 to contents

**Payout:**
- Deductible: $75,000 (15% of $500,000)
- Dwelling payment: $25,000 ($100,000 - $75,000)
- Personal property payment: $0 (doesn't exceed $75,000 deductible)

### Example 2: Homeowners Choice - Separate Deductibles
- Dwelling Coverage: $500,000, 15% deductible
- Personal Property: $25,000, 10% deductible
- Earthquake damage: $100,000 to dwelling, $15,000 to contents

**Payout:**
- Dwelling deductible: $75,000
- Dwelling payment: $25,000 ($100,000 - $75,000)
- Personal property deductible: $2,500 (10% of $25,000)
- Personal property payment: $12,500 ($15,000 - $2,500)

**Deductible Waiver Applies:**
Since dwelling damage ($100,000) exceeds dwelling deductible ($75,000), the personal property deductible is waived:
- Actual personal property payment: $15,000 (full amount, no deductible)

## Important Notes

1. **Deductibles are Percentages**: Unlike most insurance, CEA deductibles are calculated as a percentage of your coverage limits, not the claim amount

2. **High Deductibles**: CEA earthquake deductibles are significantly higher than typical homeowners insurance deductibles

3. **Policy Integration**: CEA earthquake insurance is designed to work alongside your regular homeowners insurance, not replace it

4. **Annual Renewal**: Policies must be renewed annually; coverage is not automatic

5. **Claims Process**: After an earthquake, you may file both a homeowners claim (for fire, water damage) and a CEA claim (for earthquake damage)
