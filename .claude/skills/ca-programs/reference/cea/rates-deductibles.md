# CEA Earthquake Insurance: Deductibles and Premium Calculation

## Deductible Options

CEA earthquake insurance offers five deductible options, calculated as a **percentage of your coverage limit**, not the claim amount:

### Standard Deductible Choices:
- **5%** of coverage limit (lowest deductible, highest premium)
- **10%** of coverage limit
- **15%** of coverage limit (California state-mandated minimum for basic policy)
- **20%** of coverage limit
- **25%** of coverage limit (highest deductible, lowest premium)

## Deductible Restrictions

### High-Value Homes:
Homes with **Coverage A dwelling limit greater than $1,000,000** are **restricted to**:
- 15% deductible
- 20% deductible
- 25% deductible

**Lower deductibles (5% and 10%) are NOT available for homes valued over $1 million.**

### Older Homes Without Retrofits:
Dwellings **built before 1980** on a raised or other non-slab foundation that **do not have a verified seismic retrofit** are **restricted to**:
- 15% deductible
- 20% deductible
- 25% deductible

**Lower deductibles (5% and 10%) require either:**
- Home built in 1980 or later, OR
- Home built before 1980 with verified seismic retrofit

## How Deductibles Work

### Percentage-Based Calculation:
Unlike traditional insurance deductibles (flat dollar amounts), CEA deductibles are calculated as a percentage of your **coverage limits**, not your claim amount.

### Example Calculations:

#### Example 1: $500,000 Home with 15% Deductible
- Coverage A (Dwelling): $500,000
- Deductible: 15%
- **Deductible Amount: $75,000**

If earthquake damage is $100,000:
- You pay: $75,000 (deductible)
- CEA pays: $25,000

#### Example 2: $800,000 Home with 10% Deductible
- Coverage A (Dwelling): $800,000
- Deductible: 10%
- **Deductible Amount: $80,000**

If earthquake damage is $150,000:
- You pay: $80,000 (deductible)
- CEA pays: $70,000

#### Example 3: $1,200,000 Home (Restricted to 15% Minimum)
- Coverage A (Dwelling): $1,200,000
- Deductible: 15% (lowest available for this home value)
- **Deductible Amount: $180,000**

If earthquake damage is $250,000:
- You pay: $180,000 (deductible)
- CEA pays: $70,000

### Coverage-Specific Deductibles (Homeowners Choice Only):

With the Homeowners Choice policy, you can select **different deductibles** for dwelling and personal property:

#### Example: Separate Deductibles
- Dwelling: $600,000 coverage, 15% deductible = $90,000 deductible
- Personal Property: $25,000 coverage, 10% deductible = $2,500 deductible

**Special Rule - Deductible Waiver:**
If dwelling damage exceeds the dwelling deductible, the personal property deductible is **waived** for the same earthquake event.

**Example:**
- Dwelling damage: $120,000 (exceeds $90,000 deductible)
- Personal property damage: $15,000
- Result: Personal property deductible ($2,500) is waived
- Personal property payout: $15,000 (full amount)

## Premium Calculation Factors

CEA earthquake insurance premiums are based on multiple risk factors:

### Primary Rating Factors:

#### 1. Location and Seismic Risk
- Proximity to active fault lines
- Earthquake zone designation
- Historical seismic activity in area
- Soil type and liquefaction potential

#### 2. Home Characteristics
- **Age of home**: Older homes = higher premiums
  - Pre-1940: Highest risk category
  - 1940-1959: High risk
  - 1960-1979: Moderate-high risk
  - 1980-1999: Moderate risk
  - 2000+: Lower risk (modern building codes)

- **Construction type**:
  - Wood frame: Lowest premium (most earthquake-resistant)
  - Steel frame: Low-moderate premium
  - Concrete: Moderate premium
  - Unreinforced masonry: Highest premium (most vulnerable)

- **Number of stories**:
  - One story: Lowest premium
  - Two stories: Moderate premium
  - Three+ stories: Higher premium

- **Foundation type**:
  - Slab foundation: Lower premium
  - Raised foundation (cripple wall): Higher premium
  - Hillside foundation: Highest premium

#### 3. Retrofit Status
Homes with **verified seismic retrofits** qualify for premium discounts:
- **Older houses**: Up to **25% discount**
- **Mobilehomes**: Up to **21% discount**

**Qualifying Retrofits:**
- Cripple wall bracing
- Foundation bolting
- Soft-story retrofitting (multi-unit buildings)
- Must be verified by licensed contractor or engineer

#### 4. Deductible Selected
- **5% deductible**: Highest premium
- **10% deductible**: High premium
- **15% deductible**: Moderate premium
- **20% deductible**: Low premium
- **25% deductible**: Lowest premium

**Typical Premium Difference:**
Choosing a 25% deductible over a 5% deductible can reduce your premium by approximately **40-50%**.

#### 5. Coverage Limits
- Higher dwelling coverage = Higher premium
- Higher personal property limits = Higher premium
- Building code upgrade coverage = Additional premium
- Loss of use coverage = Additional premium

### Premium Comparison Examples:

#### Scenario 1: Low-Risk Home
- Location: Low seismic zone
- Built: 2010 (wood frame, 1 story, slab foundation)
- Dwelling Coverage: $400,000
- Deductible: 15%
- **Estimated Annual Premium: $400-$800**

#### Scenario 2: Moderate-Risk Home
- Location: Moderate seismic zone
- Built: 1985 (wood frame, 2 stories, raised foundation)
- Dwelling Coverage: $600,000
- Deductible: 15%
- **Estimated Annual Premium: $1,200-$2,000**

#### Scenario 3: High-Risk Home
- Location: High seismic zone (near fault)
- Built: 1965 (raised foundation, no retrofit)
- Dwelling Coverage: $800,000
- Deductible: 20% (restricted due to age/foundation)
- **Estimated Annual Premium: $2,500-$4,500**

#### Scenario 4: Very High-Risk Home
- Location: Very high seismic zone
- Built: 1950 (unreinforced masonry, 3 stories)
- Dwelling Coverage: $1,500,000
- Deductible: 25% (restricted due to value)
- **Estimated Annual Premium: $6,000-$12,000+**

## Premium Discounts

### Retrofit Discount (Up to 25%)
- Requires verification of qualifying seismic retrofit
- Must be completed by licensed professional
- Discount applies annually as long as retrofit remains in place

### Deductible Selection Discount
- Choosing higher deductible significantly reduces premium
- 25% deductible vs. 5% deductible: ~40-50% premium savings
- 20% deductible vs. 10% deductible: ~25-30% premium savings

### Multi-Policy Considerations
- CEA policies sold through participating insurers
- May qualify for package discounts with homeowners policy
- Varies by insurance company

## State-Mandated Basic Policy

California law (Insurance Code Section 10089.5) requires CEA to offer a **basic earthquake insurance policy** with:
- Dwelling coverage matching underlying homeowners policy Coverage A limit
- **15% deductible** (standard)
- **$5,000** personal property coverage
- **$1,500** additional living expenses (loss of use)

This basic policy represents the **minimum coverage option** and typically has the **lowest premium** for mandatory coverage components.

## Cost Management Strategies

### 1. Increase Deductible
**Impact:** Significant premium savings
**Trade-off:** Higher out-of-pocket costs in event of claim
**Best for:** Homeowners with emergency savings, financial reserves

### 2. Reduce Personal Property Coverage
**Impact:** Moderate premium savings
**Trade-off:** Less protection for contents
**Best for:** Homeowners with minimal valuable contents or separate coverage

### 3. Retrofit Your Home
**Impact:** Up to 25% premium discount
**Trade-off:** Upfront retrofit costs ($3,000-$10,000)
**Best for:** Long-term homeowners, older homes
**ROI:** Typically recovers retrofit cost within 5-10 years through premium savings

### 4. Decline Optional Coverages
**Impact:** Lower total premium
**Trade-off:** Gaps in protection
**Options to consider declining:**
- High personal property limits (stick with minimum $5,000)
- Additional building code upgrade coverage (beyond included $10,000)

### 5. Homeowners Choice Policy
**Impact:** Customized coverage = potential savings
**Trade-off:** More complex policy structure
**Best for:** Homeowners who want specific protection (e.g., dwelling only)

## Important Deductible Considerations

### 1. Deductibles Are High
CEA earthquake deductibles are **substantially higher** than typical homeowners insurance deductibles:
- Typical homeowners deductible: $500-$2,500
- Typical CEA deductible (15% of $500,000): $75,000

### 2. Financial Preparedness
Homeowners should have financial resources to cover the deductible:
- Emergency savings fund
- Home equity line of credit (HELOC)
- Disaster assistance programs
- SBA disaster loans

### 3. Deductible Applies Per Event
- Each earthquake event triggers a new deductible
- Aftershocks within 72 hours typically considered same event
- New earthquake after 72 hours = new deductible applies

### 4. Deductible vs. Premium Trade-off
**Lower Deductible (5-10%):**
- Pros: Lower out-of-pocket if claim occurs
- Cons: Significantly higher annual premiums
- May pay $10,000-$20,000+ more in premiums over 10 years

**Higher Deductible (20-25%):**
- Pros: Much lower annual premiums
- Cons: Higher out-of-pocket if claim occurs
- Savings of $1,000-$3,000+ per year in premiums

## Deductible Application Rules

### Standard Policy:
- One deductible applies to all coverages combined
- Deductible based on Coverage A (dwelling) limit
- Single calculation for entire claim

### Homeowners Choice Policy:
- Separate deductibles may apply to dwelling and personal property
- Dwelling deductible based on Coverage A limit
- Personal property deductible based on Coverage C limit
- **Waiver rule**: If dwelling damage exceeds dwelling deductible, personal property deductible is waived

### Coverages With NO Deductible:
- **Loss of Use/Additional Living Expenses (Coverage D)**: No deductible
- **Building Code Upgrade Coverage**: No deductible (applies after dwelling deductible met)
