CEA is not-for-profit. Our insurance rates are based on the best available science and research, not profit.

Choose the earthquake insurance coverage that fits your needs and budget. We work with [participating residential insurance companies](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") who sell and service our residential earthquake insurance policies for homeowners, renters, condo-unit owners and mobilehome owners.

## Follow these four easy steps to buy earthquake insurance in California

**Step 1:** Know Your Risk.

Learn about [your risk](/california-earthquake-risk "Earthquake Risk"), and [how to get prepared](/california-earthquake-risk/personal-preparedness "Personal Preparedness").

**Step 2:** Get an Earthquake Insurance Cost Estimate.

The cost of your policy depends on many factors: the [earthquake risk where you live](/california-earthquake-risk "Earthquake Risk"), the age of your [home, construction type](/prepare-your-house-earthquake-risk/structural-risks "Structural Risks"), and the coverages and deductibles you choose. CEA offers flexible coverage choices as well as more deductible options to help you [find a policy that best meets your needs and budget](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies "Insurance Policies"). Use our [Premium Calculator](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-premium-calculator "Premium Calculator") to estimate the cost of your earthquake insurance policy.

**Step 3**: Find your [insurance company](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") on CEA’s participating residential insurance companies list.

Buy a CEA earthquake insurance policy through one of our participating insurance companies. **CEA does not offer stand-alone policies.** You must have a residential property insurance policy with one of our providers in place in order to purchase a CEA earthquake policy – see the [CEA participating residential insurance companies](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers").

**Step 4:** Call Your Insurance Company.

You can buy a CEA insurance policy from the same insurance company you purchased your homeowners or renters policy.

Share the premium estimates with your agent. They will process your application, handle bill payment and policy renewal, and help you file a claim in case of earthquake damage or loss.

You don’t have to wait until your residential policy renews to buy a CEA policy. Protect your home today, before the next big earthquake strikes.

Contact your [residential insurance agent](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") you already know and trust to get CEA earthquake coverage today.
