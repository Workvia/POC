CEA offers earthquake insurance premium discounts for older houses that have been retrofitted to better withstand earthquakes.

What is a retrofit? A retrofit, sometimes called a seismic retrofit, involves [strengthening your house to make it more resistant to earthquakes.](/prepare-your-house-earthquake-risk "Is your house ready for an earthquake?")

We also offer a discount for mobilehomes that have been reinforced or built to better withstand earthquakes.

Does your house or mobilehome qualify for a CEA premium discount?

### Discounts for single-family homes:

You may be eligible to receive up to a **25%** **discount** on your CEA earthquake insurance premium if your house:

* Was [built before 1980](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-policy-premium-discounts/how-to-qualify-for-policy-discount "Your House's Characteristics"),
* Is wood-frame construction,
* Is on a raised foundation or other [foundation type](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-policy-premium-discounts/how-to-qualify-for-policy-discount "Your House's Characteristics") that is not entirely slab, and
* Has been seismically retrofitted in accordance with California standards.\*

Special documentation of your completed and verified retrofit must be sent to your [residential insurer](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") in order to receive the discount. See the chart below to learn how to get a Hazard Reduction Discount.

### If your house already has a seismic retrofit

If your house already has been properly retrofitted, work with an Inspection Professional ([contractor](https://www.californiaresidentialmitigationprogram.com/resources/find-a-contractor/) or a [structural engineer](https://www.californiaresidentialmitigationprogram.com/resources/find-a-contractor/find-a-licensed-design-pro/)) to verify your retrofit. We have created a directory for your convenience to help you choose and hire an [Inspection Professional](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-policy-premium-discounts/inspection-professionals-search "Inspection Professionals Search") in your area.

Work with your [Inspection Professional](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-policy-premium-discounts/inspection-professionals-search "Inspection Professionals Search") to fill out the [CEA Earthquake Insurance – Dwelling Retrofit Verification (DRV) form](/sites/default/files/document/cea-earthquake-insurance-dwelling-retrofit-form.pdf "CEA Earthquake Insurance Dwelling Retrofit Form 2019 (PDF)") (PDF) and submit it to your [residential insurer](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers"). The instructions below will aid your Inspection Professional in filling out the DRV form.

### Discounts for mobilehomes:

You may receive a **21% discount** on your CEA earthquake insurance premium if your mobilehome:

* Has been reinforced by an earthquake-resistant bracing system certified by the [California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)](https://www.hcd.ca.gov "California Department of Housing and Community Development"), or
* Has been installed on an approved foundation system in accordance with subdivisions (a) or (b) of section 18551 of the California Health and Safety Code.

If your mobilehome has already been certified with an earthquake-resistant bracing system, submit a copy of a final inspection report that verifies prior issuance of a building permit and that the system and installation meet one of the eligibility criteria above to your residential insurer to obtain your premium discount.

To obtain the necessary forms to get your bracing system certified by HCD, or to learn more about installing an earthquake-resistant bracing system on your mobilehome, please contact [HCD](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/manufactured-and-mobilehomes "California Department of Housing and Community Development").

## Get Help to Pay for a Retrofit

A brace and bolt retrofit may cost several thousand dollars—the actual price depends on your house.

We offer [a brace + bolt program](/prepare-your-house-earthquake-risk/brace-and-bolt-grants "Earthquake Retrofit Grants") to help!

*\* To qualify for a premium discount, a house with a seismic retrofit must have the following elements, either as originally built or a subsequent improvement or seismic retrofit:*

* *If the house has [cripple walls](/prepare-your-house-earthquake-risk/structural-risks/cripple-wall-house "Cripple Wall House"), they all must be braced in accordance with CEBC standards, as determined by an inspection conducted in accordance with the CEA Earthquake Insurance – Dwelling Retrofit Verification Form (PDF) Requirements; or the home has a valid Brace + Bolt verification number.​*
* *If a house has a [post-and-pier](/prepare-your-house-earthquake-risk/structural-risks/post-pier-house "Post & Pier House"), post-and-beam, or unreinforced masonry brick/stone foundation, the dwelling must, in compliance with CEBC standards, have foundations that are placed continuously under all exterior bearing walls, and be anchored to the perimeter foundation. In addition, all cripple walls must be braced as noted above.*
* *A water heater that is properly secured to the building frame, in accordance with Guidelines for Earthquake Bracing of Residential Water Heaters (California Department of General Services, Division of the State Architect).*

### Why am I not eligible for a discount if my house is not a raised or other foundation type?

If your house's foundation is not one of the types listed above, it is likely categorized as slab, which typically is a four- to twelve-inch concrete layer that is poured directly at ground level (also called "grade level") and acts as a first-floor sub-surface.

Since a slab foundation house is built at ground level, and supported by concrete, it is already more earthquake resistant. As this foundation type is already more likely to better withstand earthquake damage, your CEA earthquake insurance premium already reflects this lower rate.
