Condo-Unit Owners

Protect your investment with earthquake coverage with a condo-unit owner policy. After an earthquake hits, you are responsible for replacing appliances, windows, flooring and valuables. In other words, without an earthquake policy in place, you will be responsible for repairing the damage for everything inside your home, replacing all of your belongings, as well as any HOA special assessment to cover the deductible for common area damage.
