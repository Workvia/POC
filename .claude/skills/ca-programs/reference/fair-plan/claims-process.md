###### Already have a claim?

After your claim is received, an examiner will reach out to you as soon as possible. In times of catastrophe, there may be a delay due to the large volume of claims filed.

## Reporting a Claim

It is the insured's duty under the policy to report, to the FAIR Plan, any loss or damage to covered property. The notice of loss is considered received once the FAIR Plan is notified of the loss, by either the insured or the insured's broker.

##### FAQs

## What you need to know

* [###### Can my broker report a claim for me?](#)

  Your broker can, at your request, submit the claim to the FAIR Plan for you.
* [###### When should I file a claim?](#)

  As soon as a loss happens, you should file a claim so we can get the claims process started. We will need to inspect the property in its damaged condition, so please do not make repairs except to protect the property from further damage. If you do make repairs to protect the property from further damage, please take photographs of the property prior to making repairs, and please do not destroy any of the damaged property.
* [###### When will someone contact me about my claim?](#)

  An adjuster will contact you as soon as possible. If your loss occurred as part of a catastrophe, there may be a time delay to contact you due to the large claims volume.
* [###### What does my policy cover?](#)

  Contact your broker so he or she can walk you through the coverages and perils (causes of loss) you purchased. You should also refer to your policy contract for details.
