## Property Types Covered for Earthquakes

As a participating member company of the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), the FAIR Plan offers earthquake coverage for customers with a FAIR Plan Dwelling Fire policy.  
  
Earthquake coverage is available through the CEA for the following:

### Dwellings

1-4 unit residential dwellings.

### Condominium

Building Property coverage that can help you repair interior walls, flooring, fixtures and windows when the inside of your condo unit is damaged by an earthquake.

### Renters

Protect your belongings and cover the cost of living elsewhere if your rental is damaged and in need of repairs after a quake.

### Mobile & Manufactured Homes

Policy coverage includes earthquake damage to your mobile or manufactured home and structures attached to it, like your garage.

A stand-alone earthquake policy written by the FAIR Plan is not available. You must have an in-force FAIR Plan policy to qualify for CEA coverage through the FAIR Plan.

Visit the [California Earthquake Authority website](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/) for more detailed information about the CEA and available coverage options.

To discuss your insurance needs, please contact a licensed broker. Brokers may be able to offer you additional insurance options that provide more comprehensive coverage than the FAIR Plan. Additionally, you may wish to contact more than one broker to see whether they can offer you coverage through other insurers. Not all brokers are registered to work with the FAIR Plan.
