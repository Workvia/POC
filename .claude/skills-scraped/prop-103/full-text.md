On November 8, 1988, Californians passed the Insurance Rate Reduction and Reform Act, better known as [Proposition 103](/?s=prop+103). What follows below is the complete, original text of the ballot initiative.

> *NOTE: Changes made by the state Legislature and the Courts are noted in different colored-text (green for additions, red  
> for deletions). For the complete text noting the repeal of  
> then-existing laws (Section 7), please consult the 1988 California  
> General Election Voter Information Pamphlet or the Insurance Code at  
> your local law library.*

**Insurance Rate Reduction and Reform Act**

**Section 1. Findings and Declaration.**

The People of California find and declare as follows:

Enormous increases in the cost of insurance have made it both unaffordable and unavailable to millions of Californians.

The existing laws inadequately protect consumers and allow insurance  
companies to charge excessive, unjustified and arbitrary rates.

Therefore, the People of California declare that insurance reform  
is necessary. First, property-casualty insurance rates shall be  
immediately rolled back to what they were on November 8, 1987, and  
reduced no less than an additional 20%. Second, automobile insurance  
rates shall be determined primarily by a driver’s safety record and  
mileage driven. Third, insurance rates shall be maintained at fair  
levels by requiring insurers to justify all future increases. Finally,  
the state [Insurance Commissioner](/search/?searchQuery=%22Insurance+Commissioner%22)  
shall be elected. Insurance companies shall pay a fee to cover the  
costs of administering these new laws so that this reform will cost  
taxpayers nothing.

**Section 2: Purpose.**

The purpose of this chapter is to protect consumers from arbitrary  
insurance rates and practices, to encourage a competitive insurance  
marketplace, to provide for an accountable [Insurance Commissioner](/search/?searchQuery=%22Insurance+Commissioner%22), and to ensure that insurance is fair, available, and affordable for all Californians.

**Section 3: Reduction and Control of Insurance Rates.**

Article 10, commencing with Section 1861.01 is added to Chapter 9 of Part 2 of Division 1 of the Insurance Code to read:

**Insurance Rate Rollback**

1861.01.(a) For any coverage for a policy for automobile and any other  
form of insurance subject to this chapter issued or renewed on or after  
November 8, 1988, every insurer shall reduce its charges to levels  
which are at least 20% less than the charges for the same coverage  
which were in effect on November 8, 1987.

(b) Between November 8, 1988, and November 8, 1989, rates and  
premiums reduced pursuant to subdivision (a) may be only increased if  
the commissioner finds, after a hearing, that an insurer is  
substantially threatened with insolvency.

**[The California Supreme  
Court unanimously upheld the rollback but struck down the  
“substantially threatened with insolvency” standard. The court  
substituted a “fair rate of return” constitutional standard, leaving it  
to the Commissioner to determine on a company-by-company basis, through  
the individual rollback exemption hearings, whether the rate rollback  
would deprive an insurer of a fair rate of return.]**

(c) Commencing November 8, 1989, insurance rates subject to this  
chapter must be approved by the commissioner prior to their use.

(d) For those who apply for an automobile insurance policy for the  
first time on or after November 8, 1988, the rate shall be 20% less  
than the rate which was in effect on November 8, 1987, for similarly  
situated risks.

(e) Any separate affiliate of an insurer, established on or after  
November 8, 1987, shall be subject to the provisions of this section  
and shall reduce its charges to levels which are at least 20% less than  
the insurer’s charges in effect on that date.

**Automobile Rates & Good Driver Discount Plan**

1861.02. (a) Rates and premiums for an automobile insurance policy,  
as described in subdivision (a) of Section 660, shall be determined by  
application of the following factors in decreasing order of importance:

> (1) The insured’s driving safety record.
>
> (2) The number of miles he or she drives annually.
>
> (3) The number of years of driving experience the insured has had.
>
> (4) Those other factors that the commissioner may adopt by regulation  
> and that have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss. The  
> regulations shall set forth the respective weight to be given each  
> factor in determining automobile rates and premiums. Notwithstanding  
> any other provision of law, the use of any criterion without approval  
> shall constitute unfair discrimination.

**[Insurance Code Section 1861.02(b) was amended by the state Legislature.**

**Amendments are noted in green.]**

(b) (1) Every person who (A) has been licensed  
to drive a motor vehicle for the previous three years and (B) has had,  
during that period, not more than one conviction for a moving violation  
which has not eventually been dismissedEvery person who meets the criteria of Section 1861.025  
shall be qualified to purchase a Good Driver Discount policy from the  
insurer of his or her choice.  
An insurer shall not refuse to offer and sell a Good Driver Discount  
policy to any person who meets the standards of this subdivision.

(2) The rate charged for a Good Driver Discount policy shall comply  
with subdivision (a) and shall be at least 20% below the rate the  
insured would otherwise have been charged for the same coverage. Rates  
for Good Driver Discount policies shall be approved pursuant to this  
article.

(3) (A) This subdivision shall not prevent a  
reciprocal insurer, organized prior to November 8, 1988, by a motor  
club holding a certificate of authority under Chapter 2 (commencing  
with Section 12160) of Part 5 of Division 2, and which requires  
membership in the motor club as a condition precedent to applying for  
insurance from requiring membership in the motor club as a condition  
precedent to obtaining insurance described in this subdivision.

(B) This subdivision shall not prevent an insurer which requires  
membership in a specified voluntary, nonprofit organization, which was  
in existence prior to November 8, 1988, as a condition precedent to  
applying for insurance issued to or through those membership groups,  
including franchise groups, from requiring such membership as a  
condition to applying for the coverage offered to members of the group,  
provided that it or an affiliate also offers and sells coverage to  
those who are not members of those membership groups.

(C) However, all of the following conditions shall be applicable to the insurance authorized by subparagraphs (A) and (B):

> (i) Membership, if conditioned, is conditioned only on  
> timely payment of membership dues and other bona fide criteria not  
> based upon driving record or insurance, provided that membership in a  
> motor club may not be based on residence in any area within the state.  
> (ii) Membership dues are paid solely for and in consideration  
> of the membership and membership benefits and bear a reasonable  
> relationship to the benefits provided. The amount of the dues shall not  
> depend on whether the member purchases insurance offered by the  
> membership organization. None of those membership dues or any portion  
> thereof shall be transferred by the membership organization to the  
> insurer, or any affiliate of the insurer, attorney-in-fact, subsidiary,  
> or holding company thereof, provided that this provision shall not  
> prevent any bona fide transaction between the membership organization  
> and those entities.  
> (iii) Membership provides bona fide services or benefits in  
> addition to the right to apply for insurance. Those services shall be  
> reasonably available to all members within each class of membership.

Any insurer that violates clause (i), (ii), or (iii) shall be subject to the penalties set forth in Section 1861.14.

(c) The absence of prior automobile insurance coverage, in and of  
itself, shall not be a criterion for determining eligibility for a Good  
Driver Discount policy, or generally for automobile rates, premiums, or  
insurability.

**[Insurance Code Section 1861.02(d), noted in green below, was added to the Insurance Code by the state Legislature. It was NOT part of the original text of [Proposition 103](/?s=prop+103).]**

(d) An insurer may refuse to sell a Good Driver  
Discount policy insuring a motorcycle unless all named insureds have  
been licensed to drive a motorcycle for the previous three years.

(d)(e) This section  
shall become operative on November 8, 1989. The commissioner shall  
adopt regulations implementing this section and insurers may submit  
applications pursuant to this article which comply with such those regulations prior to that date, provided that no such application shall be approved prior to that date.

**[Insurance Code Section 1861.025, noted in green below, was added to the Insurance Code by the state Legislature. It was NOT part of the original text of [Proposition 103](/?s=prop+103).]**

1861.025. A person is qualified to purchase a Good Driver Discount policy if he or she meets all of the following criteria:

(a) He or she has been licensed to drive a motor vehicle for the previous three years.

(b) During the previous three years, he or she has not done any of the following:

(1) Had more than one violation point count determined as provided by  
subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), or (h) of Section 12810 of  
the Vehicle Code, but subject to the following modifications:

A. For the purposes of this  
section, the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident for  
which he or she was principally at fault that resulted only in damage  
to property shall receive one violation point count, in addition to any  
other violation points which may be imposed for this accident.

B. If under Section 488 or 488.5 an insurer is prohibited from  
increasing the premium on a policy on account of a violation, that  
violation shall not be included in determining the point count of the  
person.

C. If a violation is required to be reported under Section 1816 of  
the Vehicle Code, or under Section 784 of the Welfare and Institutions  
Code, or any other provision requiring the reporting of a violation by  
a minor, the violation shall be included for the purposes of this  
section in determining the point count in the same manner as is  
applicable to adult violations.

(2) Had more than one dismissal pursuant to Section 1803.5 of the  
Vehicle Code that was not made confidential pursuant to Section 1808.7  
of the Vehicle Code, in the 36-month period for violations that would  
have resulted in the imposition of more than one violation point count  
under paragraph (1) if the complaint had not been dismissed.

(3) Was the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident that  
resulted in bodily injury or in the death of any person and was  
principally at fault. The commissioner shall adopt regulations setting  
guidelines to be used by insurers for the their determination of fault  
for the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (1) of subdivision  
(b).

(c) During the period commencing on January 1, 1999, or the date 10  
years prior to the date of application for the issuance or renewal of  
the Good Driver Discount policy, whichever is later, and ending on the  
date of the application for the issuance or renewal of the Good Driver  
Discount policy, he or she has not been convicted of a violation of  
Section 23140, 23152, or 23153 of the Vehicle Code, a felony violation  
of Section 23550 or 23566, or former Section 23175 or a violation of  
Section 191.5 or \*\*\* subdivision (a) of Section 192.5 of the Penal Code.

(d) Any person who claims that he or she meets the criteria of  
subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) based entirely or partially on a  
driver’s license and driving experience acquired anywhere other than in  
the United States or Canada is rebuttably presumed to be qualified to  
purchase a Good Driver Discount policy if he or she has been licensed  
to drive in the United States or Canada for at least the previous 18  
months and meets the criteria of subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) for  
that period.

**Prohibition on Unfair Insurance Practices**

1861.03 (a) The business of insurance shall be subject to the laws of  
California applicable to any other business, including, but not limited  
to, the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Sections 51 through 53, inclusive, of  
the Civil Code), and the antitrust and unfair business practices laws  
(Parts 2 (commencing with Section 16600) and 3 (commencing with Section  
17500) of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code).

**[Insurance Code Section 1861.03(b) was amended by the state Legislature. Additions are noted in green, deletions in red.]**

(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit (1) any  
agreement to collect, compile and disseminate historical data on paid  
claims or reserves for reported claims, provided such data is  
contemporaneously transmitted to the commissioner, or (2) participation in any joint arrangement established by statute or the commissioner to assure availability of insurance.,  
(3) any agent or broker, representing one or more insurers, from  
obtaining from any insurer it represents information relative to the  
premium for any policy or risk to be underwritten by that insurer, (4)  
any agent or broker from disclosing to an insurer it represents any  
quoted rate or charge offered by another insurer represented by that  
agent or broker for the purpose of negotiating a lower rate, charge, or  
term from the insurer to whom the disclosure is made, or (5) any  
agents, brokers, or insurers from utilizing or participating with  
multiple insurers or reinsurers for underwriting a single risk or group  
of risks.

(c) (1)Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a notice of  
cancellation or non-renewal of a policy for automobile insurance shall  
be effective only if it is based on one or more of the following  
reasons:

> (A) non-payment of premium;
>
> (B) fraud or material misrepresentation affecting the policy or insured;
>
> (C) a substantial increase in the hazard insured against.

**[Insurance Code Section 1861.03(c)(2), noted in green below, was added to the Insurance Code by the state Legislature. It was NOT part of the original text of [Proposition 103](/?s=prop+103).]**

(2) This subdivision shall not prevent a reciprocal  
insurer, organized prior to November 8, 1988, by a motor club holding a  
certificate of authority under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section  
12160) of Part 5 of Division 2, and which requires membership in the  
motor club as a condition precedent to applying for insurance, from  
issuing an effective notice of nonrenewal based solely on the failure  
of the insured to maintain membership in the motor club. This  
subdivision shall also not prevent an insurer which issues private  
passenger automobile coverage to members of groups that were in  
existence prior to November 8, 1988, whether membership, franchise, or  
otherwise, and to those who are not members of groups from issuing an  
effective notice of nonrenewal for coverage provided to the insured as  
a member of the group based solely on the failure of the insured to  
maintain that membership if (i) the insurer offers to renew the  
coverage to the insured on a nongroup basis, or (ii) to transfer the  
coverage to an affiliated insurer. The rates charged by the insurer or  
affiliated insurer shall have been adopted pursuant to this article.  
However, all of the following conditions shall be applicable to that  
insurance:

(A) Membership, if conditioned, is conditioned only on timely  
payment of membership dues and other bona fide criteria not based upon  
driving record or insurance, provided that membership in a motor club  
may not be based on residence in any area within the state.

(B) Membership dues are paid solely for and in consideration of the  
membership and membership benefits and bear a reasonable relationship  
to the benefits provided. The amount of the dues shall not depend on  
whether the member purchases insurance offered by the membership  
organization. None of those membership dues or any portion thereof  
shall be transferred by the membership organization to the insurer, or  
any affiliate of the insurer, attorney-in-fact, subsidiary, or holding  
company thereof, provided that this provision shall not prevent any  
bona fide transaction between the membership organization and those  
entities.

to the right to apply for insurance. Those services shall be reasonably  
available to all members within each class of membership.

**[Insurance Code Section 1861.05(c) was amended by the state Legislature. Additions are noted in green.]**

**Approval of Insurance Rates**

1861.05. (a) No rate shall be approved or remain in effect which is  
excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in  
violation of this chapter. In considering whether a rate is excessive,  
inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, no consideration shall be given  
to the degree of competition and the commissioner shall consider  
whether the rate mathematically reflects the insurance company’s  
investment income.

(b) Every insurer which desires to change any rate shall file a  
complete rate application with the commissioner. A complete rate  
application shall include all data referred to in Sections 1857.7,  
1857.9, 1857.15, and 1864 and such other information as the  
commissioner may require. The applicant shall have the burden of  
proving that the requested rate change is justified and meets the  
requirements of this article.

(c) The commissioner shall notify the public of any application by  
an insurer for a rate change. The application shall be deemed approved  
sixty days after public notice unless (1) a consumer or his or her  
representative requests a hearing within forty-five days of public  
notice and the commissioner grants the hearing, or determines not to  
grant the hearing and issues written findings in support of that  
decision, or (2) the commissioner on his or her own motion determines  
to hold a hearing, or (3) the proposed rate adjustment exceeds 7% of  
the then applicable rate for personal lines or 15% for commercial  
lines, in which case the commissioner must hold a hearing upon a timely  
request. In any event, a rate change application shall be  
deemed approved 180 days after the rate application is received by the  
commissioner (A) unless that application has been disapproved by a  
final order of the commissioner subsequent to a hearing, or (B)  
extraordinary circumstances exist. For purposes of this section,  
“received” means the date delivered to the department.

(d) For purposes of this section, extraordinary circumstances include the following:

(1) Rate change application hearings commenced during the 180-day  
period provided by subdivision (c). If a hearing is commenced during  
the 180-day period, the rate change application shall be deemed  
approved upon expiration of the 180-day period or 60 days after the  
close of the record of the hearing, whichever is later, unless  
disapproved prior to that date.

(2) Rate change applications that are not approved or disapproved  
within the 180-day period provided by subdivision (c) as a result of a  
judicial proceeding directly involving the application and initiated by  
the applicant or an intervenor. During the pendency of the judicial  
proceedings, the 180-day period is tolled, except that in no event  
shall the commissioner have less than 30 days after conclusion of the  
judicial proceedings to approve or disapprove the application.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing shall preclude the  
commissioner from disapproving an application

without a hearing if a stay is in effect barring the commissioner from holding a hearing within the 180-day period.

(3) The hearing has been continued pursuant to Section 11524 of the  
Government Code. The 180-day period provided by subdivision (c) shall  
be tolled during any period in which a hearing is continued pursuant to  
Section 11524 of the Government Code. A continuance pursuant to Section  
11524 of the Government Code shall be decided on a case by case basis.  
If the hearing is commenced or continued during the 180-day period, the  
rate change application shall be deemed approved upon the expiration of  
the 180-day period or 100 days after the case is submitted, whichever  
is later, unless disapproved prior to that date.

the commissioner to adopt those regulations, or commence or resume

commencing hearings required by subdivision (c) of Section 1861.05
