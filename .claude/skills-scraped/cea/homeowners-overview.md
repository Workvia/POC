## Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Earthquakes?

##### Your homeowners policy doesn’t cover earthquake damage.

In most cases, damage to your home from an earthquake is not covered by a homeowners insurance policy. In California, a separate policy is needed to protect your home investment and recover from the effects of a major earthquake. Prepare today with CEA earthquake homeowners insurance.

### Home (dwelling)

Learn More

Coverage for your house can be purchased alone or with other coverages. Policy choices include earthquake damage to your house and structures attached to it, like your garage. Deductibles available are 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25%. Homes with a Coverage A dwelling limit greater than $1,000,000, or dwellings built before 1980 on a raised or other type foundation that do not have a [verified retrofit](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-policy-premium-discounts "Premium Discounts"), are only eligible for a 15%, 20% or 25% deductible.

### Personal Property

### Loss of Use

Learn More

Where would you live if after a major earthquake you couldn’t occupy your home? Loss of Use covers the additional cost of living elsewhere while your home is being rebuilt or when a civil authority prevents entry to your neighborhood because of earthquake damage. Keep in mind you may be paying your mortgage while in temporary rental housing. Loss of Use not only covers rent but also additional items, including food, moving, and storage expenses. Our Loss of Use coverage never has a deductible.

![Building Code Upgrade](/sites/default/files/images/04buildingcodeupgrade-infographic.jpg)

### Building Code Upgrade

Learn More

Older homes that are damaged by a major earthquake may need upgraded components like plumbing, electrical, heating and air conditioning systems to pass local and state building inspections. Rebuilding after a devastating earthquake generally must be done to current building-code standards. Get help with added costs with Building Code upgrade coverage. A $10,000 building code upgrade coverage is included with every CEA homeowner policy—and there are higher coverage limits available.

### Emergency Repairs

Learn More

Emergency and necessary repairs may be needed after an earthquake to help protect your house and your family’s safety from additional earthquake damage or aftershocks. This would include rain damage that could seep into your home from earthquake damage—or labor and materials needed to board up damaged windows or remove broken glass from furniture. The first $1,500 has no deductible.

## What Do I Need to know about CEA Earthquake Insurance?

For many California homeowners, owning a home is one of their largest financial investments. Earthquake insurance can help cover related expenses following a devastating shaking event.

CEA premiums are determined by several factors including your home’s age, earthquake-risk location data such as proximity to a fault and soil type, foundation type, construction type, and roof type.

Contact your home insurance agent to discuss adding a separate earthquake policy to your homeowners insurance. You can add the coverage today—no need to wait until your homeowners policy comes up for renewal.

CEA works with [residential insurance companies](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") that serve the majority of California homeowners. Only Californians whose home is insured by those companies are eligible to purchase a CEA earthquake policy.
