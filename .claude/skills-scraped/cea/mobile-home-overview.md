Mobilehomes are vulnerable to shaking, often bearing major foundation damage from a large earthquake.

A CEA policy is catastrophe insurance, meant to cover the most important things you own. To purchase a CEA policy, [contact your home insurance company](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") or agent.

CEA is one of the largest providers of California earthquake residential insurance. CEA is not-for-profit. Our insurance rates are based on the best available science and research, not profit.

## Does Mobilehome Insurance Cover Earthquakes?

##### Your mobilehome policy doesn’t cover earthquake damage.

In most cases, your mobilehome owner insurance policy does not cover earthquake damage to your home. In California, a separate policy is needed to protect your mobilehome investment and recover from the effects of a major earthquake. Be prepared with a CEA mobilehome earthquake policy.

### Loss of Use

Learn More

You may need temporary housing while your home is being repaired or if a civil authority keeps you out of the area due to earthquake damage. Loss of Use covers the additional cost of living elsewhere, while you may still be paying your mortgage. It also covers additional items, including food, moving, and storage expenses. This CEA coverage never has a deductible.

### Building Code Upgrade

Learn More

Older mobile homes that are damaged by a major earthquake may need upgraded components such as plumbing, electrical, heating and air conditioning systems to pass local and state building inspections. Rebuilding after a devastating earthquake generally must be done to current building-code standards. A $10,000 building code upgrade coverage is included with every CEA mobilehome policy. For more help with added costs choose available Building Code upgrade coverage with even higher limits.

## What do I Need to know about CEA Mobilehome Earthquake Insurance?

Earthquake insurance can help cover related expenses following a devastating shaking event.

CEA premiums are determined by several factors including your home’s age, earthquake-risk location data such as proximity to a fault and soil type, foundation type, construction type, and roof type.

Contact your home insurance agent to discuss adding a separate earthquake policy to your homeowners insurance. You can add the coverage today—no need to wait until your homeowners policy comes up for renewal.

CEA works with [residential insurance companies](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") that serve the majority of California homeowners. Only Californians whose home is insured by those companies are eligible to purchase a CEA earthquake policy.

## How to Qualify for a Mobilehome Discounted Premium

You may be eligible for CEA mobilehome earthquake insurance policy discount (21%) if you own a retrofitted mobilehome. Mobilehomes that have been properly retrofitted have a better chance to withstand earthquakes. A seismic retrofit involves strengthening your dwelling to make it more resistant to shaking.

To receive a [discount](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-policy-premium-discounts/how-to-qualify-for-policy-discount "Your House's Characteristics") on your CEA earthquake insurance premium, your mobilehome:

* Must be reinforced by an earthquake-resistant bracing system certified by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), or
* Has been installed on an approved foundation system in accordance with subdivisions (a) or (b) of section 18551 of the California Health and Safety Code.
