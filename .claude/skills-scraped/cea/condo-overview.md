A CEA condo unit policy is catastrophe insurance, meant to cover the most important things you own. To purchase a CEA policy, [contact your home insurance company](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") or agent.

In most cases, earthquake damage to the inside of your unit is not covered by your residential insurance policy. To protect your investment in your condo unit and belongings, you need a separate earthquake policy.

CEA is not-for-profit. Our insurance rates are based on the best available science and research, not profit.

Talk to your [home insurance agent](/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/participating-residential-insurers-earthquake "Participating Residential Insurers") about CEA earthquake coverage choices to fit your needs and budget.

## Does Condo-Unit Insurance Cover Earthquakes?

##### Your earthquake loss isn’t covered by your condo-unit or HOA insurance.

In most cases in California, your condo-unit policy does not cover damages from the shaking by an earthquake. A separate condo-unit earthquake insurance policy is required to cover the effects of a quake.

Without an earthquake policy, you will be responsible for replacing and repairing the damage to the inside of your unit including appliances, flooring, walls, electronics, furniture, clothing and sporting equipment.

You will also be responsible for additional expenses if you need to move to temporary housing while your building or unit is under repair.

### Building Property

Learn More

If your homeowners association (HOA) has earthquake insurance, it covers only the outside of the condominium buildings and the common areas. Individual condo-unit owners earthquake policies cover the contents inside the walls of the condo unit, not the structure itself. Building Property coverage helps you repair interior walls, flooring, fixtures and windows when the inside of your condo unit is damaged by an earthquake.

### Loss of Use

Learn More

When there is quake damage to your condominium building or condo unit, a civil authority may restrict access to your building or condo unit. Loss of Use covers the cost for additional living expenses if you must live outside your home. Keep in mind you may be still paying your mortgage while in temporary rental housing. Loss of Use not only covers temporary rent but also food, moving, and storage expenses. Loss of Use coverage never has a deductible or time limit.

### Loss Assessment

Learn More

Loss Assessment coverage helps pay your share of certain additional assessments levied by your HOA on its members for earthquake-damage repairs or to pay a master-earthquake policy deductible. This coverage can help with charges for repairs to the exterior of your condo development or certain common areas, as well as building code upgrades.

### Building Code Upgrades

Learn More

Older condo units that are damaged by an earthquake may need upgraded components such as plumbing, electrical, heating and air conditioning systems to pass local and state building inspections. Rebuilding after a devastating earthquake generally must be done to current building-code standards.

![Emergency Repairs](/sites/default/files/images/05emergencyrepairs-infographic.jpg)

### Emergency Repairs

Learn More

Emergency and necessary repairs may be needed after an earthquake to help protect your condo unit and your family’s safety following earthquakes or aftershocks, or to prevent rain damage that may occur after a major earthquake. This could include labor and materials needed to board up damaged windows or remove broken glass from furniture.
